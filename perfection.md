Both subjective and objective
To be better than the rest, than to be better than the best
Something unobtainable, a light that guides us
We crave for it in different things, and reach for it in different ways, but we all want it
We all [[dream]], and I won't tell you how to live yours.

If I disagree with your methods and you can't explain why you do it the way that you do, but it is certainly driven by your crave for perfection, please remind me of what I wrote here `by writing [[perfection]]`
