What does it mean to be proficient? [[Wikipedia]], somewhat surprisingly, offers no help; so it must be defined here.

I consider myself proficient once I feel comfortable that I have enough skill to survive in all likely situations without external aid. Examples:

- **In #language** this means I can navigate social situations with relative ease
- **In #programming üë®‚Äçüíª** This means I can accomplish any task presented (obviously provided I understand the needed tools aside from the programming language), if not in the best possible way
- This means being able to tie a knot to aid with all functional situations, to be able to read music and play it with practice

Proficiency does not mean being anywhere close to perfect, that's [[Expertise]], but being good enough to do well.
