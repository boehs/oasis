Hey! I am writing this list because I know too many programming langudges and dunno what to choose. I include the following:

- Common uses
- Tech area
- Detailed description
- Things I hate/love
- Syntax
- Popularity

Note some languages are excluded because a better no-cost version exists (looking at you JavaScript). Typically, this means that someone hiring you for a language would be fine if you programmed in the "better" version. They will be indicated like:
- ~~JavaScript~~ TypeScript

To prevent bias, Languages are ordered alphabetically.

Enjoy! 

## Actual list

- C++
- C#
- C
- Crystal
- Clojure
- D
- Dart
- Erlang
- Elm
- Elixer
- Fortran
- Groovy
- Nim
- Python
- Rust
- Raku
- R
- Swift
- Java
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Go
- Perl
- PureScript
- Haskell
- Kotlin
- PHP
- Scala
- Julia
- Racket
- Zig

## Removing the nonos

### Duplicates

- Typescript is objectively better than JavaScript in every single way, so ~~JavaScript~~
- Raku is probably better than ~~Perl~
	- But it confuses me
### Baddies

#### Elm

Redescribing the elm governance issues would be redundant, but if you are interested

#### JavaScript

TypeScript outclasses it

#### Java

Kotlin outclasses it

#### PHP

Sorry, don't want to start a flame war but we all know it's true, don't start a project in PHP
