Hey! I am writing this list because I know too many programming langudges and dunno what to choose. I include the following:

- Common uses
- Tech area
- Detailed description
- Things I hate/love
- Syntax
- Popularity

Note some languages are excluded because a better no-cost version exists (looking at you JavaScript). Typically, this means that someone hiring you for a language would be fine if you programmed in the "better" version. They will be indicated like:
- ~~JavaScript~~ TypeScript

To prevent bias, Languages are ordered alphabetically.

Enjoy! 

## The list
