I use email, lots. Sorta because I use [[sourcehut]] tons and those folk are real into [[mailing lists]] but also because my mom and my boss uses email, my clients reach me via email, I signup for websites via email, etc.

As my usage grows, I have found myself using email more and more, and it is time to ask what is the best way to effectively use it, specifically from a technical POV.

# But I overthink

Is there not a crossover between work and life? I love Programming. I now maintain three emails, alias@domain, evan@domain, and contact@domain

### alias

for things I expect to spam, for non meaningful services

### contact

my contact form, populates `+` alias with `photography`, `hire`, `other`

### otherwise

I use evan@domain. Work and life, mailinglists and not. Don't spam me please.

# Spam

> \<evan> Wait so when you use a mailing list your email becomes public online in the archives. aint that lead to lots of spam?
> \<garlic bread> yes
> \<evan> so how do you negate that
> \<garlic bread> suck it up and start filtering shit

Is there a better way? should I add `lists@domain` to my aoronal?
