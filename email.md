I use email, lots. Sorta because I use [[sourcehut]] tons and those folk are real into [[mailing lists]] but also because my mom and my boss uses email, my clients reach me via email, I signup for websites via email, etc.

As my carrier grows, I have found myself using email more and more, and it is time to ask what is the best way to effectively use it, specifically from a technical POV. First

## What do I use email for?

First, I need to address what I use email for.

### Personal

My mom, my pal, want to reach me

### HyperWork

My workspace

### Work

My contact page, dealing with clients, looser stuff

### [[Mailing Lists]]

Not [[News Letters]], Things like the linux mailing list with threads.

### News Letters

The artifacts of a new account
