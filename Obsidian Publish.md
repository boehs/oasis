I can't stomach obsidian publish's pricing, and even if I could, I go to great lengths to ensure my website runs off as few external dependencies as possible. It would be optimal if publish was self-hostable, but alas.

Finally, due to the fact obsidian is not at the very least source available I find it hard to be "charitable".
