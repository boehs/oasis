I have come to the conclusion that web browsers are flawed like many, though to what extent I differ. **I believe the issue with [[productivity]] [[online]] is that with literally one button and zero thought you can go in any direction**

When installing october, the first app is made. This app is `google.com`.

When leaving google.com, a new window is opened. It will ask us to give this collection of windows a name, let's call it `months`. We now have two windows with two very specific states.

Go back to the google window, this time you are prompted. You can merge it into the window you just opened, or open it in a new window. I think you get the window idea, so let's open it in the window we just opened. The months window is quickly becoming an app! Let's continue adding pages to months, one for each month.
