Feel free to use \[\[[[backlinks]]\]\], [[wikilinks]], [[edges]], [[multilinks]], or [[whatever the fuck you want to call it]] anywhere when talking to me in reference to something on the [[anagora]] or otherwise, my browser will resolve wikilinks in the default order, aside from `duckduckgo` as the 3rd step for `unprefixed`.

**What?!** [[Wikilinks Everywhere]], enjoy ðŸ¥°!
