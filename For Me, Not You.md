When I write (in some circumstances save for that with the tag "blog", but I make no guarantees), I write for me. You are privileged (have the revokable permission) to have my writing available free; despite this, when I write I write for me, and optimization for you may be a second thought. This means

- **I may take no measure to ensure content is understandable**
- **Content may be my own opinion and/or intentionally or mistakenly be nonfactual.**
- **No warranty is provided, and responsibility should not be assumed**

That being said, I do hope you enjoy reading, and that it's not too bad.

Additionally, if you become aware of an issue, please open a pull request or issue on GitHub and I may action it.
