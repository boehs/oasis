There are many methodologies for moderating a community, typically through code of contact or for all intents and purposes - rules.

My communities don't live by rules. I don't think our government's well intended democracies transition perfectly to online communities, so instead I think about the idea of [[Create the culture you want|Creating the culture you want]]. This document outlines the community *I* want, and the one I help guide "mine" to.

## Democratic

## Equal

## Inclusive

## Friendly
