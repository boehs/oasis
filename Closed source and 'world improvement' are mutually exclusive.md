> [[PenPen]]'s Note: This [[node]] is about software, but it also applies to [[research]]

I'm not obsessive over [[open source]], I use what is most convenient, for me as a [[hacker]]. Often times, to get what I want out of a platform, it must be open source, but not always (\[1\] [[open source]]). Despite this, there is a subset of software that *must* be open source.

Lately, an interesting [[startup]] [[trend]] has emerged. Many new startups try to paint themselves as for a better world. They solve some problem, in some beautiful way. Perhaps it's [[decentralize]]d [[finance]], more power to the people amiright? Perhaps some solution for [[climate change]], or some amazing tool that empowers the world to write.

It's not good enough for these software to benefit it's users, no, the marketing pitch is that it makes the world a better place.

> [[Sidetrack]]: Ignoring the fact that almost all software that benefits it's users must also be benefiting the user's impact on the world, and by extension benefiting the world. Let's ignore this.

I think this is acceptable, because lots of [[software]] does do this, and it's ok to develop with that in mind. What's not ok is a service who's whole selling point is it's radicle improvement, while also being closed source.

Why? Why is something closed source?

- Secrets that benefit the world somehow. Perhaps one or two [[government]] projects fall under this.
- Wierd situations, like `bboard` on [[sdf]]. I give sdf a pass, it's a home for educators, artists, students, and other [[bright eyes]], or some necessitie to be able to provide service, like a contract.
- Profit.

All of these are ok, in my head. Naturally, only the latter is common, and is certainly the reason most of these visionary pieces are closed source.

So, I beg you, can something be for profit, AND for change in a flawed world? Many would argue even the idea of profit is flawed, and that's just the surface. In no way can for profit tools significantly improve the world. If you actually wanted to do that you would be giving back.
