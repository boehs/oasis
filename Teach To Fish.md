==Give someone a fish, and you'll feed them for a day. Teach someone to fish, and you'll feed them for a lifetime.==

Spoon feeding the answers is not in anybody's best interest. If we give you the answer on a silver platter, you'll be back the next day with the same problem without even realizing it's the same problem, because you learned nothing. Helping you understand the logic will help you understand how to arrive at the answer yourself, and will help you be able to write solutions to the same problem yourself in the future. It may seem tedious at present, but in the long run you'll save a lot of time when you don't have to ask for help with it anymore.
