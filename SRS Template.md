Version 0.1  
Prepared by Evan Boehs
<date created>  

This SRS serves to guide development of sonorous, as well as to help clarify to others why sonorous exists

sonorous is a music platform that aims to provide middle ground between streaming giants like Spotify and undergrounds like slsk. It serves as an interface and aggregator for discovering music and downloading it from peers.

### Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviations

- an underground refers to torrenting communities. Often illegal and messy.
- slsk is an abbreviation of `soulseek`, one such underground.

## 2. Product Overview

### 2.1 Product Perspective

sonorous is an independent product, split into two components: client and server. The client is a GUI for requesting and displaying information from the server.

### 2.2 Product Functions

* Users should be able to find and download music, as well as trace it to it's original album and creator
* Users should be able to find creators, and find that creators albums and songs
* Users should be able to find and download albums, and trace the albums creator
* Users should be able to find and download playlist, user created albums
* Artists should be able to monotize their work using interledger and donation urls

### 2.3 Product Constraints

* It should not be painfully obvious to the user they are using torrent software
* the client must be developed using cross platform technologies that support the following operating systems
	* Windows
	* Mac
	* Linux
	* iOS
	* Android

### 2.4 User Characteristics

There are two user classes

#### Artists

#### Users

##### Leachers

##### Seeders

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
List any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) that could affect the requirements stated in the SRS. These could include third-party or commercial components that you plan to use, issues around the development or operating environment, or constraints. The project could be affected if these assumptions are incorrect, are not shared, or change. Also identify any dependencies the project has on external factors, such as software components that you intend to reuse from another project, unless they are already documented elsewhere (for example, in the vision and scope document or the project plan).

### 2.6 Apportioning of Requirements
Apportion the software requirements to software elements. For requirements that will require implementation over multiple software elements, or when allocation to a software element is initially undefined, this should be so stated. A cross reference table by function and software element should be used to summarize the apportioning.

Identify requirements that may be delayed until future versions of the system (e.g., blocks and/or increments).

## 3. Requirements
> This section specifies the software product's requirements. Specify all of the software requirements to a level of detail sufficient to enable designers to design a software system to satisfy those requirements, and to enable testers to test that the software system satisfies those requirements.

> The specific requirements should:
* Be uniquely identifiable.
* State the subject of the requirement (e.g., system, software, etc.) and what shall be done.
* Optionally state the conditions and constraints, if any.
* Describe every input (stimulus) into the software system, every output (response) from the software system, and all functions performed by the software system in response to an input or in support of an output.
* Be verifiable (e.g., the requirement realization can be proven to the customer's satisfaction)
* Conform to agreed upon syntax, keywords, and terms.

### 3.1 External Interfaces
> This subsection defines all the inputs into and outputs requirements of the software system. Each interface defined may include the following content:
* Name of item
* Source of input or destination of output
* Valid range, accuracy, and/or tolerance
* Units of measure
* Timing
* Relationships to other inputs/outputs
* Screen formats/organization
* Window formats/organization
* Data formats
* Command formats
* End messages

#### 3.1.1 User interfaces
Define the software components for which a user interface is needed. Describe the logical characteristics of each interface between the software product and the users. This may include sample screen images, any GUI standards or product family style guides that are to be followed, screen layout constraints, standard buttons and functions (e.g., help) that will appear on every screen, keyboard shortcuts, error message display standards, and so on. Details of the user interface design should be documented in a separate user interface specification.

Could be further divided into Usability and Convenience requirements.

#### 3.1.2 Hardware interfaces
Describe the logical and physical characteristics of each interface between the software product and the hardware components of the system. This may include the supported device types, the nature of the data and control interactions between the software and the hardware, and communication protocols to be used.

#### 3.1.3 Software interfaces
Describe the connections between this product and other specific software components (name and version), including databases, operating systems, tools, libraries, and integrated commercial components. Identify the data items or messages coming into the system and going out and describe the purpose of each. Describe the services needed and the nature of communications. Refer to documents that describe detailed application programming interface protocols. Identify data that will be shared across software components. If the data sharing mechanism must be implemented in a specific way (for example, use of a global data area in a multitasking operating system), specify this as an implementation constraint.

### 3.2 Functional
> This section specifies the requirements of functional effects that the software-to-be is to have on its environment.

### 3.3 Quality of Service
> This section states additional, quality-related property requirements that the functional effects of the software should present.

#### 3.3.1 Performance
If there are performance requirements for the product under various circumstances, state them here and explain their rationale, to help the developers understand the intent and make suitable design choices. Specify the timing relationships for real time systems. Make such requirements as specific as possible. You may need to state performance requirements for individual functional requirements or features.

#### 3.3.2 Security
Specify any requirements regarding security or privacy issues surrounding use of the product or protection of the data used or created by the product. Define any user identity authentication requirements. Refer to any external policies or regulations containing security issues that affect the product. Define any security or privacy certifications that must be satisfied.

#### 3.3.3 Reliability
Specify the factors required to establish the required reliability of the software system at time of delivery.

#### 3.3.4 Availability
Specify the factors required to guarantee a defined availability level for the entire system such as checkpoint, recovery, and restart.

### 3.4 Compliance
Specify the requirements derived from existing standards or regulations, including:  
* Report format
* Data naming
* Accounting procedures
* Audit tracing

For example, this could specify the requirement for software to trace processing activity. Such traces are needed for some applications to meet minimum regulatory or financial standards. An audit trace requirement may, for example, state that all changes to a payroll database shall be recorded in a trace file with before and after values.

### 3.5 Design and Implementation

#### 3.5.1 Installation
Constraints to ensure that the software-to-be will run smoothly on the target implementation platform.

#### 3.5.2 Distribution
Constraints on software components to fit the geographically distributed structure of the host organization, the distribution of data to be processed, or the distribution of devices to be controlled.

#### 3.5.3 Maintainability
Specify attributes of software that relate to the ease of maintenance of the software itself. These may include requirements for certain modularity, interfaces, or complexity limitation. Requirements should not be placed here just because they are thought to be good design practices.

#### 3.5.4 Reusability
<!-- TODO: come up with a description -->

#### 3.5.5 Portability
Specify attributes of software that relate to the ease of porting the software to other host machines and/or operating systems.

#### 3.5.8 Proof of Concept
<!-- TODO: come up with a description -->

## 4. Verification
> This section provides the verification approaches and methods planned to qualify the software. The information items for verification are recommended to be given in a parallel manner with the requirement items in Section 3. The purpose of the verification process is to provide objective evidence that a system or system element fulfills its specified requirements and characteristics.
