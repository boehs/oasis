Hey, welcome to my digital garden. It will start off reading like a blog, but as you travel through the \[\[backlinks]] the illusion will quickly fall and my collection of interconnected notes and ramblings will become apparent. I write these notes on Dynalist's obsidian, and release them to the web via [Garden](https://github.com/plumpsw/garden) by [Plump](https://plumpsw.github.io) (It was created for this "blog", but designed in such a way that it will work for everyone) â€” over offerings such as [[Obsidian Publish]]. If you want to learn more about this style of writing, click on #meta, otherwise, why not start with a conventional blog post below, and see where it takes you?
