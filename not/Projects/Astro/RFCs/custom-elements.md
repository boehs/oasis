# Summary
This RFC defines a configuration option to make astro viable in applications where custom elements and delimiters are needed.
# Definitions
In `<%= hi %>`,
* startDelimiter: `<%`
* value: `= hi `
* endDelimiter: `%>`
# Motivation
This RFC was driven by the lack of support for EJS style templating. This style of templates uses `<%`, invalid html that astro correctly flags. It would be counterproductive to provide an exception to users of EJS, so I began thinking about how this need *I* have can be applied to needs others have. Through this RFC, users of templating engines *regardless* of what one they use feel first class.

In part two, this is extended to make templating support even better, and to introduce new renderers for executing code.
# Levels
This RFC has been split into two levels, however both levels have multiple implementation steps that can be completed individually. Level one is more pressing than two.
- Level one introduces basic support and language server support
	- [ ] It works!
	- [ ] Language server support
- Level two adds support for renderers
	- [ ] Base render support
	- [ ] File name change API
## Level One
### Example
```html
<%= hi %> <!-- This does not crash astro now, it also is syntax highlighted like ejs templates would be -->
```

```html
{{This is it's own thing, not javascript}}
```
### Detailed design
In an implementation of this design, the config object is extended to introduce a new property

```ts
interface CustomElement {
    /** RegExp for opening tag, closing tag
     * 
     * For example, if you want to make `<% hi! %>` valid, you would set match to be `[/<%/,/%>/]`
     * 
     * Or, if you wanted to do something more complex, say `<ðŸ˜‚ to="the" world>:)</ðŸ˜‚>`, you could write a regexp like `[/<ðŸ˜‚.*?>/,/<\/ðŸ˜‚>/]`
     */
	delimiters: [RegExp,RegExp]
    /**
     * Syntax Highlighting Language
     * 
     * Examples: `typescript`, `ejs`, `handlebars`
     */
	language: string,
	/**
	 * Include delimiters in output
	 * 
	 * true: `<% Value %>`,
	 * 
	 * false: ` Value `
	 * 
	 * default: true
	 */
	includeDelimiters?: boolean
}
interface Options {
	...

    /**
     * Define custom delimiters for syntax highlighting and telling the compiler to leave you alone.
     */
	CustomElements?: [CustomElement]
}
```
There are actions taken in two places
#### Compiler
For delimiters that match, the compiler essentially leaves it be, so the output will be `if (includeDelimiters) startDelimiter + value + if(includeDelimiters) endDelimiter`, it then stops processing and should not do any transformation of matched content.

This is effectively the same as `<Fragment data-astro-raw>startDelimiter value endDelimiter </Fragement>` (Note: `data-astro-raw`  is currently broken, see compiler/#263)
#### Language Server
The contents within matched delimiters are syntax highlighted as specified in `language`

---
 Test cases should be added for both compiler and language server to ensure invalid html `<%%>` elements and double braces `{{}}` are still rendered correctly, if in CustomElements.
### Drawbacks
- implementation cost, both in term of code size and complexity
### Alternatives
There are no good alternatives. Not implementing this makes astro unusable for a group of people.
## Level Two
### Example
```html
website built on node sh#node --version#sh
```
and, `index.astro` with
```html
<%= hi %>
```
becomes `index.ejs` instead of `index.html`
### Detailed description
In an implementation of this design, the `CustomElement` interface is extended to introduce a new property
```ts
interface CustomElement {
	...
    /** Renderer
     *
	 * Example `@boehs/astro-render-bash` or `@boehs/astro-render-ejs`
	 */
	renderer: string
}
```

For delimiter matches with the renderer property, instead of doing nothing, the value is passed to the renderer as if it was it's own component.

---
Additionally, while the API is subject to discussion, renderers should be able to instruct a built file's extension to be whatever it pleases instead of `html`.
### Drawbacks
- None
### Alternatives
* None
# Adoption strategy
There is little adoption cost. In terms of strategy, it should be implemented in consecutive order (level 1 bullet 1, level 1 bullet 2, level 2 bullet 1, etc). Level one bullet one (It works!) is high priority, numerous users on discord have asked about this and have been provided hacky solutions like [changing delimiters](https://stackblitz.com/edit/astroeta?file=astro%2Fsrc%2Fpages%2Findex.astro)
