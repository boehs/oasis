ðŸ§± in the [[photography]] industry so-called [[gearheads]] are known for taking pictures of brick walls pointing out all the little imperfections a specific lens or camera produces. These walls are a bit like a [[drug]]. we all know it's bad for us and yet we continue relentlessly to consume or in this case produce. When asked on this, my [[photography]] teacher (A passionate young woman working for pennies in the public school system) said after little thought

> It's not in the gear but how we use it

She then pointed me to an excessive number beautiful photos made, often deliberately, using subpar systems.

She told me to

> Forget the price, forget the sharpness, and instead focus on the *feel*

While, as of course price was a factor, her sentiment was obvious and rubbed off on me. I rented two beautiful lenses, one technically superior for a similar price, and yet opted for the runt because it was beautiful in my hands, and the images it made felt right, if less sharp.

When I returned to buy what I had rented, the shop boy was perplexed. He reminded me that [[Bono]] was better than [[Samrin]], but I relented and am still happy with what I bought.
