*An open letter to discord regarding the cruel victimization of server moderators and the state of the platform for those who care the most*

Dear Discord.inc

I joined this platform in it's intimacy. It started with love, because discord *was* my place to hang out. It connected me with the people I knew, and gave me opportunities to meet new people. I watched it grow, and I can remember when people would ask "what's discord?". Times have changed, and am proud to say I was there to watch the platform evolve. I have always been a vocal critic, rarely offering up my encouragement yet often suggesting ways things could change. I like to think I did it out of love, I wanted to see you "take a turn for the better", but I understand what is best for me is not always for you. Being in the ecosystem so long, I have found myself vested. At one point, I eagerly monitored the dataminers, looking for new exciting gifts to dig my teeth into. At another, I eagerly developed unique bots bringing new things to the servers I loved. Today, I find myself a moderator in a variety of communities. I need to thank you. Moderating has gifted me with new skills, and after restarting my excitement about programming with bot development I found myself in a much better job. I think my time vested was ultimately for the better, but today, I am done.

Being involved has not just shaped me for the better, it has made the platform's flaws blatant, and I have come discover a toxic culture of neglect. I was always aware of the problem, but in the past year or so it has become magnified by a deeper understanding of what it means to care.

I think it started with the raids, and those have continued to be prevalent. I can't imagine you are not aware, but for as long as I can remember seemingly once a week a top server is raided

### The Raids

#### Wizzing

Normally via socially engineering, this form of raiding is destructive, attempting to wreck irreversible havoc, by deleting channels, pinging @everyone, removing roles, and mass banning as possible. Typically via social engineering or flaw discovery, these are hard often hard to stop.

### The Moderation Issues

Discord, you seem to have forgotten what your platform was built on. Hard working, volunteer moderators. Despite the memes, many mods work for you because they care about something, be that video games, knitting, or soccer. Huge problems have been ignored, and it seems like you do nothing but victim shame. You have not provided mods with the tools they need to keep their communities safe, and therefor they must make tools for themselves beyond what they signed up for so they can support their communities. Some things are impossible to implement without you.

#### Proper word blacklists

Filtering is stupid, Provide small
