Devote readers of my garden will know I ski bum instead of a proper job. In my training, I learned about LAST de escalation/conflict resolution, and thought it was actually notable enough to write down, unlike the rest of my training.

## L: Listen

**Actively listen to guest concerns by giving them your full attention so that you understand the issue & their feelings.**

* If you look distracted, the guest may feel ignored or become more upset
	* If you are actually distracted, you won't understand what their complaint or issue is really about
* Don't interrupt or debate; listen to understand & empathize, not to plan your reply or a rebuttal
* Paraphrase their comments to show you've heard what they're saying

## A: Apologize

**Offer a genuine apology without excuses to show you understand their concern.**

* Saying sorry shows the guest that we take ownership of the issue
* It's an opportunity to tell the guest "We can do better"
* Simple apologies can validate their feelings (but don't condone bad behavior)
* Explain the rule/policy, but don't defend it; you're unlikely to change their mind

## S: Solve

**Engage the guest in solving the problem in a way that satisfies them and is appropriate for the company.**

* Take (or commit to taking) action
* Be collaborative & offer options
* Resist the urge to say no; turn no into yes & be creative with solutions (that are proportionate to the issue)
* Leave the guest happy and wanting to return

## T: Thank

**Sincerely thank the guest for letting us know about their concern and reiterate your commitment to the resolution.**

* Thanking someone for complaining may seem strange, but it's an essential step
* A guest telling us about an issue is an opportunity to improve and prevent the issue for future guests
* They could say nothing & simply take their business elsewhere
* Thanking a guest for complying with a rule or policy can calmly end the situation
