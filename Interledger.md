Interledger is disgusting, for the first time I can recall, save for being sick, I am on the verge of vomit. One discovery lead to another, and I quickly realized the amount of deception in interledger, and it's meanings for the [[indie web]].

> **[[PenPen]]'s note:** Evan rashly equivalated the *interledger livenet* to interledger. He did this for a noble reason, the livenet *is* often equivilated, but they are not the same. Interledger is a standard, the livenet is the implementation representing the standard. Evan also wanted me to mention that he thinks the standard is awesome! Evan also wanted to mention that he thinks the livenet is the right thing for the wrong reason. More power to the creators using it! 🦸‍♀️

At first, I thought interledger is crypto. It is not, it is a standard (largely powered by crypto) to facilitate transfers of money, agnostic of the currency used by the sender and receiver. I thought this was cool, I added coil to my site when [[imgur]] emerald began using it. I never really thought about it again, until I became involved with the indie web. It started with an email to drew:

>> on interledger and web monetization. I agree with your stance on cryptocurrency, generally, but this feels different. I don't really like coil's implementation with a fixed donation amount or the direction they are going that is making it something to be traded, but I like the idea of paying people based on my usage of their product or work (What I can afford). What are your thoughts on this system?
> There is no place for cryptocurrency in a respectable society.

This answer left me with lots to be desired, although I should have expected it (I was aware drew is a [[crypto]] hater, even more so than me). I thought about cashing out, so I went to my interledger wallet. They wanted everything. What everything?

Let me show you.

> 1. Your current residential address
> 2. Any one of the following valid government photo IDs in Latin (e.g., English, Spanish etc) or Cyrillic or Greek characters only:
	> - Passport
	> - National ID card
	> -  Driver's license
> 3. A 'live selfie'
> 4.  Please note we do not support non-Latin IDs such as Chinese, Arabic etc

It gets worse, in these places you explicitly can't upload (let's not forget the large large part of the world excluded by latin)

- Anguilla
- Antarctica
- Armenia
- Azerbaijan
- Barbados

- Bouvet Island

- Central African Republic

And *temporarily*

> \* both temporarily and under us law!?

So now we have banned half the world from interledger, an open platform, because who cares if you speak latin or not. What about gatehub?



Crypto is bad
Interledger could be great (\*but is not and never will be)
