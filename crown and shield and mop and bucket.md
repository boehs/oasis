The king was once looking for loyal aids,
To attract men of caliber, to the one most fit a pot of gold bestowed
But, to his dismay all found was greedy laymen
So, the king returned, this time wielding a mop and bucket
Those who stayed were patrons
Those who stayed had the kingdom at heart
And so they were rewarded
