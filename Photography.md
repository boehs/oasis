I mostly upload my photo's publicly to **https://photos.boehs.io**, but sometimes I feel special and put them on

I take photos of what catches my eye, but typically anything like macro/landscape/street/place, and way way way more rarely people and journalism.

This tag is for discussion of photography, generally.
