I saw someone cute today
On the other side of the glass
I glanced, she smiled back
And then we passed

I stare at your hair from the desk behind 
Watching you laugh with gabe

- Voltaire

All my friends found their people
And so I find myself
Alone.

I stare at your hair
Wishing somehow
I could be enough

> I feel life for the very first time
Love in my arms
The sun in my eyes
I feel safe in the 5am light
You carry my fears
As the heavens set fire

There is a spot on my face
My outfit could be better
My nails are forcefully raw
And my eyes are red
But on the end of the lens
They don't care
Now preserved.

Why now
It could never
Not to me
And yet it is
Scared.

Just one more thing
Till it all works out
It never does in the end
