After registering my domain, it became obvious that it was more than a name, it was liberation from oppressive tyranny. Don't get me wrong, I am not a first amendment loving bible smacker, quite the contrary.

I believe it is absolutely within, for instance, [[Google]]'s right to banish users at will from their own, free service, without explanation. That's ok. What's not ok is the utter destruction one of these attacks leaves in it's wake. You become locked out of the internet. It's Google's right to start a disaster, and our obligation to prepare for it.

Most people think they are fine. I beg them to consider the following:

- Have I actually read the ToS?
- What if the impossible happened? Will this company, with billions of members, ever look back?

The answer to that question is no. They won't even stop to tell you why they are ripping your life apart, and the destruction? It's not comprehendible
