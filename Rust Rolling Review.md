Day one (why I'm learning rust): I hope that once I learn rust I Will be writing the most preformant code possible. If I really want to, I would use C, but I have heard that on top of the abundantly performant code, rust provides a great developer ecosystem.

## Review

### Great learning ecosystem

There are lots of resources, the best ones being free and actively maintained (The rust book).

### Assumptions about project structure is very annoying.

Coming from python where I could run `python main.py`, I was frustrated to see I could not simply run `cargo main.rs`. There are extensions that add this functionality but they are annoying and all have their flaws as well. They work by creating a cargo project hidden away somewhere and abstracting it. When you use these tools, you lose the ability to import files. It's a monofile.
