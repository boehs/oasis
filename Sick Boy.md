I'm from the East side of America 
Where we choose pride over character 
I live on the West side of America 
Where they spin lies into fairy dust 
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is 

And don't believe the narcissism 
When everyone projects 
And expects you to listen to 'em 
Make no mistake, I live in a prison 
That I build myself, it is my religion 
And they say that I am the sick boy 
Easy to say, when you don't take the risk, boy 
Welcome to the narcissism 
We're united under our indifference 

I am, I am, I am the sick boy 
They say that I am the sick boy 
And they call me the sick boy 

Feed yourself with my life's work 
How many likes is my life worth?
