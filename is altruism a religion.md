is [[altruism]] a [[religion]]?

what about Rationality?

It has [[donate]]rs and [[believe]]rs and [[hater]]s

Of course, this begs the question of if there should be, there has been scientific studies I have not reaserched stating religion lead to less altruism in children. (https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(15)01167-7)

[[Buddhism]], [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]], [[Jainism]], [[Judaism]],  [[Sikhism]], etc, place particular emphasis on altruistic morality. Perhaps [[alturisim]] is a manifestation of [[religion]]?

Well. what makes a religion? If devotes, certainly altruism passes.

Google says

> the belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power, especially a personal God or gods.

But I don't believe this to be true. [[Hinduism]] has atheists, despite it being a religion. I am more inclined to [[Wikipedia]]'s flaky definition, although that one kindly lets me know that there is much debate, and gives me more questions than I had when I started. what is [[religion vs spirituality]]? is there really any difference, or is [[religion]] but an exercise of [[spirituality]]?

I have no clue, but I think [[altruism]] is not a [[religion]] but a [[community]]
