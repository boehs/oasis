Hey, welcome to my digital garden. It will start off reading like a blog, but as you travel through the \[\[backlinks]] the illusion will quickly fall and my collection of interconnected notes and ramblings will become apparent. 

I write these notes on Dynalist's obsidian, and release them to the web via [[Trinket]] (It was created for this "blog", but designed in such a way that it will work for everyone). 

If you want to learn more about this writing style, click on #meta, otherwise, why not start with a conventional blog post below, and see where it takes you?
