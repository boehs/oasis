Lunar1314

> I don’t care if I get hate because of this opinion, but this is my favorite paper mario final boss song.

Aramaru 1837

> Lunar1314  because you’re like 9. Haven’t even played the other games I guarantee you

Dave Mathew

> @Aramaru 1837 how about we agree that you are a jerk
> Everyone can have their own opinion
> And that it is the internet so no one cares about your opinion to begin with.

Dave Mathew

> Also i to enjoy this music, it is rather catchy!

Lunar1314

> Geez, Aramaru. Calm down. Also, i’m 14 not 9😂

Dave Mathew

> Apologies about that, ill admit it was somewhat unneeded.

Dave Mathew

> @Aramaru 1837 also instead of throwing insults at me why dont you try to get me to see things from your perspective? It would be alot more time efficient and unlike insults, actually accomplishes  something in the long run. Or you can continue to assume that i am a mere child that does not know of the...5? other paper mario games (or was it 4?) Or has even played them, both opinions, being compleatly wrong.
> But as i said ITS THE INTERNET we could go in circles all day and night an neither of us would get anywhere,
> So lets not ok?

Aramaru 1837

> Dave Mathew you never gave your side dumb fuck. All you did was come on here talking about some damn opinions or some shit. Pretty clear you didn’t intend to accomplish anything. Also, you haven’t played any other game have you? It’s not hard to know how many paper Mario games there are kid. 64, ttyd, super paper Mario, this garbage, and color splash (which was actually not bad but was too weird gameplay wise to be called a paper Mario game.)

???????

@Aramaru 1837

> Bite me.

Aramaru 1837

> ???????? Look at your profile pic, nuff said

Lunar1314

> All I said was that this was my favourite final boss song in the paper mario series, but it turned into a huge fight and I don’t understand that 😂

Aramaru 1837

> You said you dont care if you get hate so obviously you do understand dumb fuck

Brooklyn Green

> @Aramaru 1837 I know you can say whatever you want, But, Please, Can you please calm down and make a nice comment to people? Like i said, Please not say about 1,000 cuss words with this reply, Please.

Aramaru 1837

> Brooklyn Green it's not hurting you to read a quick "fuck"

Brooklyn Green

> @Aramaru 1837 Look, I'm understanding everything you're saying. I'm just here to clam you down, Not everything in the world is solved by anger.

Dave Mathew

> @Aramaru 1837 i give on singular joke like reply and i come back to see this...
> Perhaps i need to reiterate my previous point
> ITS
> THE
> INTERNET
> Also yes i have played the other games i just dont know them off the top of my head and i said i liked the music from this one, end of story opinion stated, over and done with agree or disagree, its still the internet, thus your words are nothing but mindless, pointless rageing for no exact reason which is up setting luna1314 so to prevent prolonging this bickering i will ask you to at least apologise to him  for being rude to him instead of me (the one who made you angry in the first place) and shall now be on my way.

Aramaru 1873

> Brooklyn Green and did I ask? Piss off stupid kid.

 Aramaru 1873

Dave Mathew learn how to spell raging then I'll read the rest of the literal garbage you dumped on my fucking screen idiot.

 Dave Mathew

@Aramaru 1837  can you say anything other than insults? Because its actually rather entertaning to see you flip your lid like this AND makes it impossible for me or anyone else to take you seriously.

And the fact that you are going to ignore my previous statement because of one spelling error is also rather silly of you and proves my point.

 Aramaru 1873

Dave Mathew yeah it isn't worth reading either lol. I shouldn't waste my time

 Dave Mathew

@Aramaru 1837 well since we both agree that this whole thing is pointless let us just agree to disagree and be on our way then.

 Aramaru 1873

Dave Mathew cool so fuck off

 Dave Mathew

@Aramaru 1837 nah seeing you spout pointless insults because you cant come up with an actual comeback to my remarks is rather funny to me

He he i thrive off your pointless rage

 Aramaru 1873

Dave Mathew I thought it was done why are you still here idiot

 Dave Mathew

@Aramaru 1837  as i said i thrive off your rage and anger

You want me to stop?

Stop being angry.

Easy

 Aramaru 1837

Dave Mathew not angry dumb fuck, piss off

 Dave Mathew

@Aramaru 1837 see angry

 Aramaru 1837

Dave Mathew not angry dumb fuck, piss off

 Dave Mathew

@Aramaru 1837 i see that your running out of comebacks, i can give you a few if you need them.

 Dave Mathew

@Aramaru 1837 but in all seriousness i can see that i Am being rather negative towards you and you dont really deserve that since you probably have had a really stressfull day and dont need me adding to it

Thus i apologise for my behaviour towards you up to this point and would like to turn this argument into something more positive

So i ask of you, what is your most favorite theme from the paper mario games?

 Brooklyn Green

@Aramaru 1837 Hey, Just saying some cuss words on the internet isn't gonna make someone leave, Please, For the love of God, Just be nice, Being rude in this world would be the worst way to live you're life.

EDIT: Like Dave Mathew said, You're running out of comebacks, Just stop, You ran out of ideas for cussing out kids/people. Stop, Just stop, Your a grown man (maybe a teen) on the internet cussing people out, Stop.

And yes, I know your gonna say "Aw JuSt F\*\*k OfF KId." And that's not gonna make me go away, Just stop this madness.

EDIT 2: Now that i look at you're comments/videos, It looks like you're 13, Stop being whiny just because someone doesn't agree with you, Stop trying to act like the big guy when your not, I bet you can't even beat a guy on the streets, Just stop trying to act like the hero.

EDIT 3: Your probably (Most likey you are) Gonna say "Lol LoOk At YoUR SPeLlInG" and "F\*\*K OfF KiD LoL" and

"ThAt'S ToO lOnG FoR Me To REad lOl"

EDIT 4: And being a kid (Me) Doesn't mean i can't stand up for people, We can do what we want. And, Take your middle finger and point to yourself, That's where it belongs.

 Aramaru 1837

Dave Mathew not stressful you're just annoying lol. And there's plenty of music better than this shit, even from color splash

 Metal Mario

@Aramaru 1837  uh huh,  why dont you go back to your thousand year old game and super overrated paper mario game?

 Metal Mario

@Aramaru 1837  your screen? Oh boo hoo,  lemme play a sad song for you on the worlds smallest violi-- oh wait i broke it....

 Metal Mario

@Aramaru 1837  if it was done why did you reply

 Aramaru 1837

Metal Mario nice try dumb fuck, but I haven't even played any paper Mario games except color splash. Now fuck off with your shitty excuses for jokes people have better shit to read.

 Brooklyn Green

@Aramaru 1837 ​ Aramaru 1837  Then why are you saying "PaPER MaRIO Is BETteR ThAN ThIS" Just because you saw someone (Aka Alro) Doesn't mean you can come out and say "THIS GAME IS BETTER THAN THIS" Sure, Sticker Star was pretty bad, But people can enjoy it's gameplay/music. So, Nice try you dumb f\*\*k for cussing people out even though you haven't played sticker star, Yeah, Get out, Your not welcome here. Nor Youtube.

 Aramaru 1837

Brooklyn Green I never said any game was better than this dumb ass. Learn to fucking read. And the other games obviously are akk better because they got better reviews. I don't have to waste my time on this trash. Also lean to fucking spell dip shit. It's you're not your.

 Dave Mathew

@Aramaru 1837  well i see that my sympathy was misplaced

You seriously judge a game on what other people say about it?

You sir have missed many a good game

Also shame on you! Dont give out criticism if you dont actually have the knowledge to back it up

Its just stupid to say somethings wrong and then give no evidence at all to support your theory

And thats researching 101!

 Dave Mathew

@Aramaru 1837 also it appears that you really do only know how to spit out insults

...

I am going to have fun with this

 Lunar1314

Dave mathew I’ve had fun with this chain of replies for weeks now 😂

 Dave Mathew

@Lunar1314 heh, im glad you are enjoying it! Its rather easy to take something negative and make it positive!  Also while i am at it, have a nice day!

Or night...

Depends on the time zone  your in really.

 Brooklyn Green

@Lunar1314 Hope you are enjoying it.

P.S He stopped replying, So victory!!!!

EDIT: Just reported him, So say goodbye to all of those comments, Maybe his videos too.

 Lunar1314

Welp, was fun while it lasted! This one’s going in the memory album 👌

 Brooklyn Green

@Lunar1314 Well, It was, Aramaru 1837, See you next time, Or, Never again.

 Brooklyn Green

Aramaru 1837 Still hasn't replied, Wow, What a coward.

 Lunar1314

Lol

 Brooklyn Green

@Lunar1314 Alright, So i was looking at the internet and found this image, This fits Aramaru 1837 sooo freaking well. https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus\_asset/file/6696033/paper\_mario\_meta.0.jpg

 TheWaterMan

@Aramaru,

Complains how someone hasn’t played the first three paper mario games

Hasn’t played the first three himself

I mean don’t get me wrong I hate this game but this guy is the most uncivil person I’ve ever seen argue about this game

 Brooklyn Green

@TheWaterMan IKR?

 Brooklyn Green

@Lunar1314 Ikr?

 DeadlyHawk98

First time I've seen a comment chain like this in a couple years thanks for the laughs.

 Lunar1314

DeadlyHawk98 ur welcome i guess 😂 i didn’t intend my comment to turn into this, but i’m glad it did!

 REDTHEPIKMINMASTER 23

@Aramaru 1837 Yeah your argument can't continue since you've only played PMCS not to be toxic, but any point you make here is literally negated by that fact. So please be grown up for once; and yes I know that I'm in the argument now so go ahead and hate on me I've never been insulted so I'd love to see you try. Ok now that that's settled please play the other games if you get the chance their really good if you like RPG Mario games and are pretty nice in general.

 Aramaru 1837

REDTHEPIKMINMASTER 23 I'm talking about music dumb fuck not gameplay so stfu pussy lol. Regardless, I have played 64 and ttyd just not all the way through so I don't really count it.

 TheFireGaming

Wtf I thought this chain ended

 Brooklyn Green

@Aramaru 1837 Oh God, He's back.

 Brooklyn Green

@TheFireGaming Me too.

 REDTHEPIKMINMASTER 23

Brooklyn Green not while I’m alive and I still like this song >:3

 REDTHEPIKMINMASTER 23

Brooklyn Green naw jk I just wanted to say that one thing in case he wants to come back with his insult shotgun.

 Brooklyn Green

@REDTHEPIKMINMASTER 23 Alright.

 TheWaterMan

Ah, so you’re Aramaru. I didn’t want to cuss, but please, shut the fuck up, no one care about your opinion on this thread. You just sound like a baby having a tantrum while the rest of us just look at you, laughing. So please, so you don’t sound any stupider than you do now, shut up 🙃

 Dave Mathew

@Aramaru 1837 hello again my old friend

I see your here to argue once again

To bad this will end with you weeping

Because your argument is less than the dust im sweeping.

But you will not give up yet

Because you dont realize that

Itsssssss the iiiiiiiiinterrrrrrrrrrneeeeeeeeeeeeeet!

The internet!

So you migt as well be voiceless

As all arguments here are practically worthless!

( a special song/poem about the argument you still presist on dispite the flaws in your argument)

Ps. You still havent told me what your favorite song in the series is.

Aramaru 1837

> PNG HotDog Hudson did I ask? No bitch I didn't. fuck off.

Aramaru 1837

> Dave Mathew stfu I didn't even read what u said because I just know it's dumb as shit lol.

Dave Mathew

> @Aramaru 1837 whats this? You wont even try to argue against me now?
> VICTORY IS MINE! MINE!
> YOU INCOMPETENT FOOL! MINE! MUHAHAHAHAHAHA!
> Muser dooser no one likes a sore loser!
> (seriously though you are still doing this? Just accept that you were in the wrong here and move on with your life...or stay here and continue arguing, your reactions are rather funny to me.)

Dave Mathew

> @TheWaterMan  true, but that dosent mean you cant get a laugh out of them.
> When people throw insults at you instead of giving you a actual logical reason as to why they think your opinion is wrong, you know for a fact that they will compleatly lose it if you stop taking them seriously. Case in point with my long "argument" with aramaru...
> His reactions are still funny though.

Magolor

> @Aramaru 1837 dont mind me im only making this comment to spectate the craziness from my notifications (I have an anime to watch now) and let me throw in some firewood into the fire by admitting that this is a better mario ost than most of the other mario rpgs combined, yes even the first 2 mario and luigi series games (popples boss theme is an exeption) and this game has more charm than you! sits in a lawnchair and grabs popcorn and a drink ok everyone else can take on this loser from here!

Aramaru 1837

> ???????? You must be gay? Stfu pussy

Metal Mario

> @Aramaru 1837  oh so your only expierience was color splash,  yeah mine was sticker star,  so what?

Aramaru 1837

> Metal Mario nah, had a decent amount of experience with the other games. Enough to get the jist, just not the whole games. And I feel bad for you if this is the only one you have experience with.

Metal Mario

> @Aramaru 1837  well i feel bad for you if you think im supposed to care what the hell you think,  asshole.  Im glad i played this one first,  and you're cheap attitude wont change that.  Ever.

Metal Mario

> @Magolor  dude,  the second game was awesome (please tell me you know the second one was partners in time,  not bowsers inside story)

Magolor

> @Metal Mario yes I know it was partners in time, my opinion was exaggerated a bit but imo the boss and battle themes in partners in time arent as good as the others (beside elder princess shroob phase 2 that one was somber and epic combined flawlessly) but I mean when you compare it to the upbeat, catchy, mischievous chaos from superstar saga's battle and boss themes and the half serious, and climactic themes fitting bowser like a glove and the cheerful, upbeat theme that scream mario and luigi working together to destroy small enemies and that boss theme... it fit both bowser and mario bros equally! Not to mention the bis remake on 3ds that gave dark fawful an ominous and threatening remix of his/cackletta's theme and the dark star's new boss theme is intense and is as kingdom hearts esque as it gets , not to mention dream team and paper jam had amazing soundtracks all over, pit on the other hand most of the soundtrack is meh, to great at best and doesnot compare to before or after imo

Metal Mario

> @Magolor  well i thought partners in time kicked the soundtrack for paper jam in the rear end,  but hey,  i guess i usually prefer underrated games now.  I like sticker star and partners in time.

TheWaterMan

> takes long sip out of cup from appropriate fast food place Partners in Time had a nice soundtrack, it fits the atmosphere and a good boss (and final boss) theme. I’d say it has almost as good as a soundtrack as DKCTF which has my favorite video game soundtrack (best, ice area, music, eveeeeeer)

Metal Mario

> @TheWaterMan  well at least one thing we can agree on.

TheWaterMan

> Yeah none of the M&L games have been bad (imo) with Paper Jam being the weakest. I think it’s because all the other games were like, “Ok let’s take the mario world and flip it on its head” like having strange enemy, boss, and world designs but they seem like worlds that would be in a mario game (I mean, who tf came up with Piranha Planet and where can I high 5 em’?) Paper Jam just has normal mario enemies and normal Mario worlds (I could say the same for another game, cough cough SS cough cough). Still a good game, with good music, and cool boss fights (even if the bosses are recycled from past games)

As for the rest:

Dream Team was ok and the first three were a better trequel than Kung-fu Panda

 Metal Mario

@TheWaterMan  yeah,  i just wish nintendo remade partners in time instead of ditching the true sequel for the third game.

 TheWaterMan

Ikr, they just said “Partners In Time? What’s that?” Did they think it was too dark? Maybe they just couldn’t think of a Bowsers Minions addition to that. Maybe it’s because at the end of Bowsers minions, the final boss is a bunch of Fawfuls robots, which you see in the third game. It’s also interesting to see the robots in Superstar Saga because it means Fawful planned from the beginning to overthrow Cacklette. Whatever it is, it’s sad to see a good game get pushed under the rug (I’m getting SPM flashbacks)

 Metal Mario

@TheWaterMan  well, maybe its a timeline change,  maybe they will remake Partners as a third entry...

 TheWaterMan

Good News: in Bowser Juniors Journey (FYI. It’s a sideplot in BIS) one of the fights (mandatory at that) is with the two shroobs in Bowsers freezer

Now yes, this fight happens in normal Bowsers inside story but I find it odd they would add it into the sub-plot as a MANDATORY fight unless they were foreshadowing a remake of PiT

But sadly I have come to two possibilities

Option A: they make a PiT remake on the switch

Option B: Sadly though, with the death of the 3DS (god bless its soul) I doubt we’d get a PiT remake on the Switch we did get SS and PiT on the Wii U as ports but those were ports, not remakes

Which option happens? no one knows besides Nintendo.

 TheWaterMan

Sigh...I have bad news,

Literally after I wrote my comment, I found a video on YT explaining how Alpha Dream (the company that made the M&L games) has gone bankrupt. I guess that explains the SuperStar and Bowsers inside story remakes, they needed a last ditch effort to get money, but sadly for them, the 3DS was dying when these games were released

 Metal Mario

@TheWaterMan  well they just need to remake it. Maybe nintendo can buy alphadream and just go from there.

 Brooklyn Green

​@Aramaru 1837 Alright, I haven't touched this argument in awhile, But, Are you for real still fighting with these people? Like, You are such a baby and can't stand what it's like with someone not agreeing with you, It's really sad to see this on a f\*\*king Paper Mario video

 Aramaru 1837

Brooklyn Green didn't ask you to respond dumb fuck so piss off pussy

 Brooklyn Green

@Aramaru 1837 ah, with the classic "p\*\*s off p\*\*\*\*y" you really are starting to run out of comebacks, here, take this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48rz8udZBmQ

 TheWaterMan

Oh yeah...forgot this was an argument chain.

 Brooklyn Green

@TheWaterMan yeah

 Wolf Productions

Lunar1314 oh, thank god! I thought I was the only one!

 Metal Mario

@Aramaru 1837  i see even after the death of a company,  you still mumble like a deranged teenager who only threatens the english language.

 Dave Mathew

Wow this conversation has exploded since i was last here!

 Brooklyn Green

@Dave Mathew Yeah man, Also @Lunar1314 This is your 100th reply on a comment!

 Lunar1314

Last time I was here the comment had around 68 replies or something LMAO

 Lunar1314

Also, I didn’t know metal was flammeble, because @Metal Mario is on FIRE

 Aramaru 1837

Brooklyn Green who needs support in a fucking online argument? This isn't court dumb ass 😂 stfu.

 TheWaterMan

@Brooklyn Green Well to be fair, a Single person can carry an argument on their back if they provide solid evidence and look at both sides of the argument fairly.

But does that mean our good friend over here is doing that?

N O

 Lunar1314

Wow, 9 hours later and there are already 6 more comments. This is the best comment chain EVER

 Lunar1314

Even if this comment chain DOES come to an end, I’ll never forget it. Thanks for the laughs, guys. I’ve been sick for a while now, and this really makes my days a bit brighter. :’D

 Metal Mario

@Aramaru 1837  do you ever try to think before typing your shit on your screen?

 Metal Mario

@Lunar1314  uhm... Ok? I wouldnt say on fire but ok then.

 Metal Mario

@Brooklyn Green  well,  whatever he thinks a win is,  sounds like a piece of shit to me.

 Metal Mario

@Brooklyn Green  hmm.  Good point.

 Colorisia Lys

"I don’t care if I get hate because of this opinion, but this is my favorite paper mario final boss song."

116 reply

bruh

 Lunar1314

@Colorisa Lys LMAO I never thought anyone would even reply at all.

 Lunar1314

This comment chain really is something else. How about we give it a name? I’m thinking...

‘THE SPECTACULAR COMMENT CHAINNNNNNNNN’

You really have to drag out the ‘N’ for it to sound good

 Howboutno

@Brooklyn Green I'm not here to argue but how has this argument lasted over 2 months  🤣

 Howboutno

@Brooklyn Green dont worry hes just trying to make himself look cooler by going along with the "better" opinion when he can't realise that not everyone has the same cookie cutter opinion As him

 Brooklyn Green

@Howboutno Yeah, He's one big idiot.

 Lunar1314

\*paper mario FINAL boss theme actually...

 Lunar1314

...But, yeah, everyone desserves to have an opinion of their own!

 Brooklyn Green

@Lunar1314 Oh, But still

 Fox McCloud

@Aramaru 1837 bruh can u dont

 Greyplayz

10 months ago

147 replies.. Uh oh. I agree with you a bit, but not the best. I can totally see why, though.

 Greyplayz

@Aramaru 1837 Calm down. Just a Paper Mario opinion.

 Greyplayz

@Lunar1314 You can always expect fights with opinions that are mostly controversial.

 Greyplayz

@Aramaru 1837 You keep laying the F bomb. Nice and very classy.

 Greyplayz

@Dave Mathew yeah its rather hilarious.

 Greyplayz

@Aramaru 1837 Has it occured to you that your replies have 0 likes and theirs do?

 Greyplayz

@Aramaru 1837 To quote you: Lunar1314  because you’re like 9. Haven’t even played the other games I guarantee you

You're saying he hasn't played a game and critiquing about him, and you haven't either? nice

 Greyplayz

@Brooklyn Green Good.

 Greyplayz

@Aramaru 1837 Why're you back? To seek the attention and give us more laughs at you?

 Greyplayz

@Aramaru 1837 Doesn't mattey if you're gay or not, what does that have to do with ANYTHING related at all.

 Greyplayz

@Aramaru 1837 I've just realised I've been reading a 4 year old's comments who just learned what cussing is for 7 and a half minutes.

It's really funny. You're just defending yourself cuz' nobody's agreeing with you and you don't have a leg to fall back on.

 Dave Mathew

@Aramaru 1837 are you seriously still doing this?

Really? I started this argument weeks ago and you are still doing this dispite several different people pointing out each and every one of the flaws in your "arguments" so let me make this clear

You haven't played any of the paper mario games all the way through (you said it yourself)

The one you did play you didn't beat

You compleatly ignored this game because you believed the game review opinions instead of makeing your own opinion  on the game

You only respond with insults Most of which are repeats of previous ones

You refused to take a civil approach to the argument when I apologized for my rude behaviour and instead used it to insult me more

You have no base, no experience, no opinion thats your own and exluding your insults, NO ARGUMENT

Just...stop

Your attempts are funny but its honestly wearing thin at this point so either accept that your wrong or leave

Not that your going to read this because your to lazy, stubborn, and self-centred to bother so I will just laugh as you mockingly reply to this without defending yourself in the slightest.

 Aramaru 1837

Greyplayz dont need anybody to agree with me. And if I did, I'd be a pussy like you, soft ass nigga

 \*Aramaru 1837

Dave Mathew read nothing you just said so you can fuck off now :OKHANDEMOJI:

 Brooklyn Green

@Aramaru 1837 Ooo! he's finally droppin' the n bomb! We got em boys!

 Aramaru 1837

Brooklyn Green I'm black dumb fuck and it's not my responsibility to waste my time reading that dumb ass shit

 Brooklyn Green

@Aramaru 1837 First of all, Yes, I know you're black, You dumbf\*\*k, Second, "It's not my responsibility to waste my time reading that" Well, Guess what? You're wrong for the 1,000th time, The reason why he made that comment is because he was explaining how dumb you're replies are, You are so stupid, Here, Take this, You deserve it, --> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjedLeVGcfE

 Dave Mathew

@Aramaru 1837 MY FRIENDS  I GIVE YOU EXHIBIT A THROUGH Z OF PROVING MY POINT

 \*Aramaru 1837

Brooklyn Green first off, not watching. Second off, didn't read lol :LAUGHINGCRYINGFACE: day something smart then I'll read.

 Aramaru 1837

Dave Mathew fuck off 9 year old

 Dave Mathew

@Aramaru 1837 Do you know anything other than insults?

I said it once but you seem to have forgotten so i will remind you

I

FEED

OFF

OF

YOUR

HATRED.

So how about no mr im going to assume sombodys age like a idiot

 Dave Mathew

@Aramaru 1837 I do not care about your age I do not care about the color of your skin, I do not care of your history or your beliefs

because all you are to me is a useless bully who can only spew insults and is to petty to even try to notice or even acknowledge evidence that proves that you are compleatly wrong, even when you yourself give said evidence, and I know for a fact that your too worthless to read this so you will never defend yourself

You are a pathetic bully that no one here will defend and no one likes.

So stop you have no point to continue.

You have no argument.

So stop.

(Though your outbursts are still somewhat funny)

 Aramaru 1837

Dave Mathew why you still here? I thought I told yo dumb ass to fuck off a long time ago

 Dave Mathew

@Aramaru 1837 you compleatly ignored what i said as expected.

And why should i listen to someone who is incapable of being civil?

 Dave Mathew

@Aramaru 1837 As I said at the begining

this is the internet

Your insults mean nothing and so do your "arguments"

 TheWaterMan

I like how Aramaru expects us to “fuck off” when he tells us too

 Aramaru 1837

Dave Mathew obviously do if yo pussy ass won't just leave the conversation

 Dave Mathew

@Aramaru 1837 ...Pffffft hahahaha!

Now i remember why I stick around!

I love to see what kind of pathetic retort and comeback you are going to make at me that i can easily tear apart!

Really it is rather satisfying to see what you come up with.

 Dave Mathew

@Aramaru 1837  ok so how about a little challenge?

If you can give one. Genuine apology to everyone for being so rude

OR

Can go at least 10 coments without any type of swearing

Ill leave and never return to this comment chain

Sound good to you?

 Aramaru 1837

Dave Mathew "pathetic retort" put that thesaurus down dumb ass nigga you don't look smart lol

 Dave Mathew

@Aramaru 1837  you just love to prove my point don't you?

 Dave Mathew

@Aramaru 1837  my offer still stands if you want me gone by the way

 Aramaru 1837

Dave Mathew then go bitch damn. Your existence is annoying anyways

 Dave Mathew

@Aramaru 1837  I see that your able to type

But you don't seem to be able to read properly.

You might want to look at the conditions I set for my departure to occur.

 Dave Mathew

@Aramaru 1837 wether or not you try to accomplish them...

Weeeeell

Thats entirely dependent on how much you want me gone now isn't it?

 Dave Mathew

...

Hm no reply from Aramaru in over 24 hours

Must have given up then

...

Huh

I guess that means we win the argument.

I think

 Brooklyn Green

@Dave Mathew Yeah, He's looking at the words he used already to see if there's more, But he used every single one.

 Dave Mathew

@Brooklyn Green  so we win by technicalities then?

 Brooklyn Green

@Dave Mathew I guess

 Dave Mathew

@Brooklyn Green  huh...

...well...thats it I guess...

...

So...do you want to have a more positive discusion of this game and its music now?

 Brooklyn Green

@Dave Mathew Yes, At lease i have some from of soft spot for this song.

 Dave Mathew

@Brooklyn Green yeah its a pretty catchy tune, its to bad that the battle ends so quickly.

Not that it isn't satisfying to pulverize bowser health down to zero in the span of a finger snap.

 Brooklyn Green

@Dave Mathew Honestly, I got goosebumps when this tune started playing, Beating Bowser with 6 slots was an epic final move, Looking back, They could of had done something with it, But its still nice.

 Dave Mathew

@Brooklyn Green indeed, I honestly think they could have done alot more with this game

I mean picture this for a moment

A new company picks this game up and combs through it to see what they can improve

I can see them making a whole lot of improvements to the game like more hidden secrets in each level, more creative stickers,  a lot more npc dialogue because its rather entertaining to see what everyone has to say, some more paperization segments (or at least implementing it into a few more areas/puzzles) much more intresting puzzles and a few new enemy's.

The music is great and the game is not really bad per say, it just missed a handfull of opportunities here and there

Its a fine game otherwise

 Dave Mathew

@Brooklyn Green Also no shame in admiting something like that friend, though he muic caught  me by surprise to when i first reached this phase

...

To bad I got compleatly incinerated mere seconds afterward.

 Brooklyn Green

​@Dave Mathew Honestly, If i could remake Sticker Star, This is my pitch, I would redo the whole story, The plot with Bowser stealing the Crown wasn't for me, I really liked the Sticker Crown and wanted to see the possibilities they can do with it, All we got from them is just boss fights, Sure, I liked them, But they could of done so much with it, Anyways, Back to the story, It begins with the Sticker Festival again, The Toads are in line to show they're greatest Stickers, With Peach and Mario being the judges, Until, Bowser breaks though and steals The Crown that has been sealed, The Minions starting firing the Mushroom Kingdom, Everyone is panicking at this point, Mario jumps though and this is where the tutorial starts, Instead of Peach telling you the controls, Bowser would talk to you giving you hints, The theme would be a Remix of the original Bowser Theme from Paper Mario (N64) and the Bowser theme from SMRPG, Of course, You lose the battle, And it shows a cutscene of Bowser taking the Sticker Crown and bringing it back to his castle, Then the whole screen turns white, If you want to see what else i would do with this, Ask me, I'll love to give my pitch on Sticker Star.

 Dave Mathew

@Brooklyn Green hm your idea seems interesting so far! I would love to hear more.

 GalacticHypernova

THIS THREAD IS CURSED!

 Julio Figueroa

GalacticHypernova Let me in on this action

 Dave Mathew

@GalacticHypernova um...

Not sure how to respond to that...

...

Ok?...yeah im going to respond with an ok

 Dave Mathew

@Julio Figueroa by all means join in on the discussion,

All idea's are welcome here!

 Julio Figueroa

Dave Mathew I sort of lost track reading through this entire string of replays and the only thing I can start with is that everyone is entitled to their own opinions but that doesn’t make them wrong because they have a different opinion but it also doesn’t mean they can harass other people because of their opinions I thought the song was nice and climatic up beat to the game

 Dave Mathew

@Julio Figueroa  I am in agreement with you, and you make a very good point.

As for the conversation

Well at the moment we are having a discussion on how the game itself could be improved

I myself believe that the game is fine but missed a handfull of opportunities here and there and the person I am discusing it with is talking about how he would improve the story (I'm currently waiting for their reply to my message to continue discussing it)

 AlphaTheEnderman

I don't care if i get hate because of THIS opinion,

Its my favorite Paper Mario game out of all of them

 Dave Mathew

@AlphaTheEnderman  that is a fair opinion to have

 Julio Figueroa

NeoPlay No hate here I thought the game was alright I just wish the battles had more to offer

 Dave Mathew

@Julio Figueroa  yes i agree the battle system could have been fleshed out a bit more than they were, Not sure how you would go about doing that though.

 Julio Figueroa

Dave Mathew Yah they only thing you get out of battles are less stickers and coins to buy more things ands stickers, it’s at a point where the game forces battles on you like the Bowser Jr and Kamek encounters are throughout the game and its full of mini bosses that aren’t exactly unique to the traditional Mario games and that is another problem, there is hardly anything original.

 Dave Mathew

@Julio Figueroa the bowser jr fights are annoying I will give you that, but I honestly found the kamek fights to be intresting due to how unique they were. While most enamys and mini bosses are kind of bland kamek actually has that flip flop sticker mechanic in his second fight which honestly caught me off guard and was a nice breath of fresh air from the regular "spam the best stickers you have untill it dies" strategy.

Which begs the question as to why they did not do something similer for the other mini bosses.

 TheWaterMan

My improvement would making a small story for each world, every PM game did it before, dividing each world into chapters and give each one a small story that is 50% related to the main plot and 50% a story that is exclusive to that chapter. SS almost did it with world 3 with the poison but still, it was lacking

 Dave Mathew

@TheWaterMan an interesting idea that i can see happening, might I ask what you would have the side story for each world be? I would love to hear it.

 Lunar1314

Geez, guys, I was gone for a week and this is what I find. I really love this. And I guess I’ll join the discussion.

 Lunar1314

In my opinion SS was not a bad game, but the awful battle system and lack of an interesting story makes it my personal least favorite of the paper mario games. I still think the game had a lot of potensial and honestly I didn’t realise that until I played CS, wich is currently my favorite of the 5 games.

 Dave Mathew

@Lunar1314  true, the battle system could have been better, and the game itself pales in comparison to the other games but it still manages to be its own thing!

Also the large amount of secrets in each area constantly make you paranoid that you are missing something, and don't get me started on the museum.

 Brooklyn Green

My dude, You're comment now has 200 replies!

 Brooklyn Green

@Dave Mathew Also, Sorry for not replying with my ideas, I have been doing some things.

 Dave Mathew

@Brooklyn Green thats ok stuff happens

 Brooklyn Green

@Dave Mathew Alright.

 Dave Mathew

@Brooklyn Green (checking back in)

Hello again forgot to ask if you were going to continue discussing your idea.

 Dave Mathew

Checks back in on the conversation

Spends 1 minute scrolling down to the bottom

"Wow...this conversation grew to insain proportions rather quickly"

 Brooklyn Green

@Dave Mathew Oh, Yeah right, Ok, So right after the white screen appears, Mario is in the Mushroom Kingdom in ruins (Like Sticker Star) And this is where the controls tutorial starts, It will have you searching everywhere to see what happen to the Kingdom, Then, After you see every single place in the Mushroom Kingdom, You go to the first level, I'll tell you more soon.

 Dave Mathew

@Brooklyn Green ok

 Dave Mathew

@Brooklyn Green ...

Ok...back  to waiting I guess.

 Brooklyn Green

@Dave Mathew oh, i'm sorry for forgetting again, i don't really want to touch the subject anymore, i would like this to leave it as it is.

 Dave Mathew

@Brooklyn Green  it's ok, thank you for contributing your idea's! Its always nice to hear other peoples opinions and idea's!

 Brooklyn Green

@Dave Mathew ​ Dave Mathew  Thanks, yeah, i just want this comment chain to come to an end, a day always must come to an end. Aramaru 1837 stop replying, (Seems he got bored of us, but we were winning anyways) and we already won it, even if he comments back, we would still win.

 Frankie Robertson

@Brooklyn Green  i just wanted you to know that I've been watching this conversation for a while now and you and your friends have my full support, I've listened to the music from this game and think it's awesome, i was wondering if we could chat for a bit about stuff like this, i'm 19 BTW and feel like some more input should be given, is that OK with you

 Frankie Robertson

@Brooklyn Green good, BTW I've played through all paper Mario games apart from the first 2 which I've seen all of, my favourite is super paper Mario, yes i know i'm gonna be in the minority of saying that but it's an awesome game, this game is OK to me with an awesome sound track that shouldn't be ignored, what's your favourite paper Mario game and why, i love exchanging opinions it's very interesting

 Frankie Robertson

@Brooklyn Green that's an awesome reply right there, it's good to know that there are others that appreciate SPM for what it is then rather then casting it aside because it's different from the rest of the series not everyone expects a story driven Mario game and it freshens up the formula i have no idea why so many people hate it (probably because most people played the first 2 games and gotten used to that formula), but that's really good to hear, BTW do you have discord

 Leo Raasch

@Aramaru 1837 When you cant write a comment without swearing words😂

 Aramaru 1837

Leo Raasch when you're an annoying piece of shit and won't fuck off 😂

 Lunar1314

Oh, sh\*t. Here we go again.

 Dave Mathew

@Aramaru 1837 OH HELLO THERE!

Ready for round two my little winy failure.

 Dave Mathew

@Lunar1314 round and round the argument goes!

When it will stop? No one knows!

 Aramaru 1837

Lunar1314 that meme has been dead fucking idiot

 Aramaru 1837

Dave Mathew I'm ready for you to piss off you worthless fuck

 Preezyy

WTF 229 Answers about beef😂😂

 Dave Mathew

@Aramaru 1837  I allready told you the terms for my departure, all you have to do is decide if you want to deal with me and fail or just give up and swallow your pride.

Which we both know is never going to happen so your stuck with me for as long as you continue this argument that you are clearly loosing!

 Dave Mathew

@Aramaru 1837 also come up with some new insults while you boil with rage you limited vocabulary degenerate.

See?

Its easy to make up far more effective insults than the average swear words if you actually use a little effort!

 Dave Mathew

@Aramaru 1837 ...hello...have you finally given up?

 Aramaru 1837

Dave Mathew there is no giving up dumb fuck it's just a meaningless conversation full of idiots except me

 Dave Mathew

@Aramaru 1837 says the guy who uses the same insults who never bothers to read the arguments, and does not even try to defend his place in the argument what so ever.

You are an idiot.

 Dave Mathew

@Aramaru 1837 On top of that, you obviously think that this conversation is not meaningless as you keep responding to everyone. Not to mention you started th9s whole thing by insulting someone because of their opinion.

 Dave Mathew

@Aramaru 1837 AND THEN, you refuse to read any argument thats a paragraph or longer, causing you to walk right into several word traps that immediately prove you are in the wrong for no real reason.

 Dave Mathew

@Aramaru 1837 NOT ONLY THAT, you never say anything meaningfull, or constructive, in any way, and are constantly rude to everyone regardless of their stance.

 Dave Mathew

@Aramaru 1837 and finally, the icing on this ten decker cake of incompetence and disappointment, you took the one opportunity I gave you to be polite and end this without a headache for you.

And you threw it back into my face WHILE ALSO, admiting that you haven't even played any of the games in earnest!

 Dave Mathew

@Aramaru 1837 I did not drag your pride through the mud and make you look like a brainless arrogant maggot.

YOU DID.

You destroyed your own argument, you ignored the statements that made you look like a fool, you chose to spit out nothing but insults.

YOUR FALT, YOUR STUPIDITY.

 Dave Mathew

@Aramaru 1837 DEAL. WITH. IT.

...

Or stick around and continue to look like a moron! Its entertaining and besides.

We win either way.

And you

Lose either way.

 Aramaru 1837

Dave Mathew don't care to read your arguments lol. As a matter of fact, I only read the first reply lol. Quit wasting my time and fuck off

 Dave Mathew

@Aramaru 1837 then you are nothing but a bottom barral fool who will have no success in life.

As I said you don't bother to defend yourself at all, that makes you an idiot.

 Dave Mathew

@Aramaru 1837 also why should I? You have no power here, and you never will. The fact that you think you do just displays your idiocy for everyone

Besides I allready gave you the requirements for my departure, or you incapable of reading as well my little maggot.

 Dave Mathew

...is he finally gone?

...

Yeah he is gone...

...

Well

... have a nice day!

 Aramaru 1837

Dave Mathew is he gone if your dumb ass would just quit replying. I didn't even read shit you said

 Pyrite

Dont worry,I recently beat sticker star,and when I first heard this music I got pumped up and ready to kill bowser.

 Dave Mathew

@Aramaru 1837  I told you that I Would only leave if you either apologized for being rude or if you went 10 comments without swearing.

You are not good at remembering things are you my little maggot?

Reading through this comment chain with the overly jovial music playing in the background was the most funny thing I've done in a while. Thanks guys❤❤❤ (Special thanks to aramaru for making this comment chain what it is today, this video just wouldn't be the same without it)

 J B

Lol u r welcome

 Phoenix Mario

When I saw the "283" comments

I immediately thought, here we go...

The damn Paper Mario community can't handle people not playing the classics, the same way I couldn't handle people getting the switch, like, years before me because they no NOTHING about Nintendo and Mario.

But I wasn't cursing at 'em or showing any aggression. Just a little irritated.

But seriously, can the Paper Mario community stop insinuating that people haven't played the originals just because they like the ones that they don't prefer.

I haven't played TTYD, but I've played Paper Mario, Super Paper Mario and Paper Mario Sticker Star, I don't have a Wii U to play that ;( 

My favourite one is Super Paper Mario, mainly because of the story/plot.

But that doesn't mean I don't like the others.

 Paper GraysterYT

Dereck Romero, Hopefully.

Paper Mario: Sticker Star was the first paper mario game I played. Then it was ttyd. It felt weird going from sticker star to ttyd because it the games felt so different.

I think it's over

Jesus Christ, This is why I hate stating my opinions to people. Because I’ll most likely get fucking shit on like this poor person did.

 The Monstrosity

@Dave Mathew My god, I love you man, I swear while i was reading I had that music and (If you have the reference) I pictured the Snatcher talking when you did, he has the same way of speaking I swear it's awesome ! (maybe you should add it as your profile pic :DDD)

You're now officially crowned by the monstrosity I am, final boss of internet.

 The Monstrosity

Also excuse me really quick but...

 The Monstrosity

@Lunar1314 Congrats on your now 300th answer on your comment ^^

 Lunar1314

@The Monstrosity I actually can't  belive this comment is this big.

Thanks for all the support!

 Visible Confusion

@Lunar1314 best comment thread i have ever read.

 Kaleb Jones

Lunar1314  Actually this was my first Paper Mario game (also have Color Splash) and I thought that this game has bad battle mechanics and story, but the music is stellar, and I’m glad I’m not the only one who thinks that!

 Kaleb Jones

Aramaru 1837 Ah I see, the “one above all”

 Mr. Hater

@Aramaru 1837 Im sorry that you had to deal with these complete IDIOTS for so long i wish i was there with you.

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew Moron #1

 Mr. Hater

@Brooklyn Green Moron #2

 Mr. Hater

 r1card0s\_

@Aramaru 1837 lol dont be so toxic

 Lunar1314

@Mr. Hater

Do you really think I would take the words coming from someone named «Mr. Hater» seriously? If I were to guess, you probably have as many good arguments as your baby sister Aramaru.

Get out of here before you get the 15+ people in this comment chain on you.

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater  it's rather cute that you think your opinion matters to me

Besides, im not criticizing your taste in  music or questioning your intelligence

That's to easy

 Dave Mathew

@Aramaru 1837 you do not learn Do you my little maggot?

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew I see you have superiorty complex and are very self centered how very hypocritical you are no better than him guess i gotta clean house and deal with little keyboard warriors like you myself.

 Mr. Hater

@Lunar1314 Haha don't make me laugh. 😂😂

Unlike you i won't be as pathetic enough to NEED "15+" people and be all like "defend me guys defend me!" But to be honest i don't blame you... if you where to face me alone you wouldn't last a day you narcissistic keyboard warrior.

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater heh, you poor naive fool

When did i ever claim that I was better then little maggot? That i am better than you?

Oh to live in your little fantasy, can you not see what i am doing here? Or are you just as blind as he is?

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater of course i can tell you are cut from the same cloth as my little maggot, so i will humour your attempts at insulting me and everyone else present.

Let's see how long you last

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew Oh i know your intentions very well and i intend to stop it i mean what the hell is wrong with you? just look at your comment "you poor naive fool?" "To live in your little fantasy?" These are things that a narcissistic self centered manchild would say how am i or anyone with half a brain cell suppose to take you seriously? There's a reason the other guy left.

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew You won't last long Dave you won't last long cuz underneath all that bravado your just a sad little boy with delusions of grandeur.

Who btw can't talk for shit.

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew So here's a piece of friendly advise turn away now and stop wasting Aramaru's time cuz if you don't by the time this is over you'll be MY little maggot.

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew No response? Guess i must've hit one of your soft spots. ;)

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater so you actually have some bite do you?

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater good, let's see what you have got

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater i will compliment you on your use of insults, as well as how you got straight to the point.

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew This conversation is over before it even started as you barely gave anything of a response as to not to hurt your fragile ego more than you already did with that narcissistic as hell start if anything i should be the one who says "Let'S sEe WhAt yoU goT" don't act like you got the upper hand as you can't even have a normal conversation anymore.

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater I thought about saying something, but decided i would wait to see what you would do.

I am disappointed that i did that now considering your lackluster response.

Also ego? Ha! You honestly think i care about something as petty as how others view me?

I speak my mind, just like you do

And if somebody has a problem with our opinion?

Well who care's?

 Antforce

I spent an entire hour reading this and it’s amazing!

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew Obviously you do otherwise you wouldn't had responded. ;)

Also "Lackluster" response?  "Our" opinion? Lmao this is getting ridiculous 😂😂 first of all you massive hypocrite did you see the kinda response you yourself made? Yeah me neither HAHAHA and second of all again "our" opinion? Don't make me laugh! 😂  Who's our? You mean the guy with the Luigi profile and the one who started this mess? Lmao yes! What would you do without them??? "Defend me guys defend me!"

 Mr. Hater

@Lunar1314 Hey come defend Dave Mathew! He needs you guys! He can't argue with me alone!

 Mr. Hater

@Brooklyn Green Hey come defend Dave Mathew! He needs you guys! He can't argue with me alone!

 Dave Mathew

@Antforce why thank you!

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater heh of course you didn't realize

I wasn't talking about lunar, i was talking about you and me

We don't care what others think of our opinion we just say whether we agree or disagree with someone's opinion

In that way, we are alike you and I, don't you agree?

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew Ah i see your trying to get on my good side as you know what they say... if you can't beat them join them.

How about this Dave? Write a full paragraph apologizing to Aramaru and i might consider agreeing with you and btw it has to be real nice so no calling him "my little maggot" otherwise i might just start calling you that myself.

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater that would require me to have, a single shred of respect towards little maggot, and in case you did not read the whole conversation,

I DID apologise to him, he threw it back into my face and used it to insult me without responding to it what-so-ever.

You on the other hand are actually participating in a "discussion" while my little maggot only responds with the same exact insults like he's a broken fax machine.

You I respect, little wasp

I don't respect the maggot

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew I checked the entire conversation TWICE and i saw no apology so let me guess because of your insecurities you deleted it right? Then guess what? do it again i want to see a full paragraph of you apologizing.

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew And if you can't do it for him then do it for me if you truly respect me. ;)

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater  while i think we can both agree that his attitude did not help the situation, i will admit that I have been a tad to aggressive with my jesting and "insults".

I am apologetic for crossing the line once or twice, not for what i said to him

Ps( the attempt at a apology is near the start of the conversation when I start talking about how he is probably just having a stressfull day and that is why he was curently being negative to others)

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater  ...hm

You make a fair point

I shall apologize to him, but do not expect a paragraph

You make sound arguments Mr. Wasp

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew Im not one to call someone by childish names but you are very hypocritical afterall so i expect nothing less anyway do go ahead.

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew Where is the apology? I don't see it.

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater thinking of what to say that won't be taken as an insult to him Mr wasp

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew Then hurry up then kid it's already been almost a day and still no apology.

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew HELLO?? are you gonna apologize or what???

 GamerOfGamers

@Mr. Hater Are you gonna fuck off, or what?

 Julio Aramayo

This is the best song of mario ever

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater do not rush me

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew It's been 2 days now so no excuses.

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew You aren't gonna apologize are you? I figured as much if you wish to continue arguing then be my guest kid.

 Mr. Hater

@GamerOfGamers Are YOU gonna fuck off, or what?

 Mr. Hater

@GamerOfGamers From now on as punishment every reply will be answer the same way.

 GamerOfGamers

@Mr. Hater but why? why wold you hate on a bunch of people are start arguments that didnt need to happen?

 Julio Figueroa

Julio Aramayo Hello other me

 Mr. Hater

@GamerOfGamers Why WOULD YOU YOURSELF hate on me and start a argument that didn't need to happen hypocrite?

 Mr. Hater

@Julio Figueroa Hello other Julio do you have shit taste like the other you?

 GamerOfGamers

@Mr. Hater hypocrite or no YOU were still the one who continued shit that didnt need to be continued, remember this is all over a fucking mario game

 Mr. Hater

@GamerOfGamers Hypocrite or no YOU where still the one who continued shit that didn't need to be continued, remember this is all over a dumbass opinion of a mario game.

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater 1 i have a life at the moment

2 you need a little bit of patience

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater 1 word

College

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew You don't go to college David. 🤦‍♂️

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater then you clearly set your expectations of me far FAR to low.

A shame really, i thought you would be smart enough, to not do what little maggot did

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew Stop lying to yourself David how about you tell me what's ACTUALLY going on?

 Spooky Boi649

@Aramaru 1837 mans talkin like we in a COD voice chat lobby

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater college, as i said before

Do you not listen or are you refusing to believe that i have a life outside of this?

Now if you exuse me, i have a music class to attend

 Dave Mathew

@Spooky Boi649 also last time i checked, cod discussions usually don't have hour long pauses between each sentence

 Spooky Boi649

@Dave Mathew no not that, only the toxicity and holy shit I didn't think you'd come back, I'm just looking at the amount of terrible comebacks coming from aramaru but then again what else would you expect from an idiot like him

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew The truth not this fantasy your living in don't be so entitled.

 Dave Mathew

@Spooky Boi649  eh it happens, also I've kinda been hanging around since he had a habbit of messaging me back constantly

Also i like to look over this intire conversation again from time to time

Ps. Nice to meet you and have a nice day spooky boi

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater  I have told you the truth

Your just doing what every self entitled person on the internet does.

Which is refusing to believe something that would render your point moot, make you look bad, or just rejecting the possibility that what the person is saying is true so you can continue to hate them.

(Edit: i will admit that this is the internet so i understand that you have to take anything i say with a grain of salt)

 Spooky Boi649

@Dave Mathew thanks you too

 No OwO

Before we continue with our regularly scheduled argument let’s just relax for a little. https://youtu.be/xke9-MexskI

 No OwO

https://youtu.be/FQi97SuYyjI just in case if you don’t like the DX version

 Mr. Hater

@Spooky Boi649 Moron #4

I mean... do i even need to comment and how stupid you sound?

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew "Your just doing what every self entitled person does on the internet" hypocritical as usual 🤦‍♂️ "render your moot" whataver that means "make you look bad" jesus christ 🤦‍♂️ "or rejecting the possibility that what the person it's saying it's true" as if your even telling the "truth" im trying to work with you yet you refuse to speak truthfully.

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew Do you really think i would believe that a person as hypocritical, narcissistic, self centered and entitled such as you is a college student IN MUSIC of all things? And that even if you  "are" that you would be working with this pandemic that's been going on right now? Pls you aren't fooling anyone David ( except idiots ) now stop lying and tell me once again what's ACTUALLY.GOING.ON.

 Spooky Boi649

​@Mr. Hater I mean....... you don't have to? if you wanna do it then, by all means, go right ahead

 Spooky Boi649

@Mr. Hater im assuming you're on aramaru's side or sumthin? idk?

 Mr. Hater

@Spooky Boi649 Your right i don't you know already you are.

 Mr. Hater

@Spooky Boi649 No such thing as "sides" here but i guess you could say that considering the parade of idiots here yourself included.

 Spooky Boi649

@Mr. Hater now before i try to come up with an insult like a 12 year old who has a constant stuttering problem (really terrible, since i'm god awful at comebacks) you wanna make the replies up to 400? i really got nothing else to do

 Mr. Hater

@Spooky Boi649 Well it's good that your self aware ( tho not that open minded ) i'll give you that much... maybe you aren't as big of a moron as i thought you where still if you want to start a week long argument then be my guest.

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater  1 truthfully i don't want to apologize to armu because i know for a fact it would not be genuine and no matter how much i hate a person, im not going to insult them by giving them a mocking half@$$ed apology.

2\. Online college classes are a thing that exist, and im not just doing a music class

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew There we go you see? What's that so hard? I knew you never had the guts to do it anyway your ego and narcissistic self wouldn't allow it but atleast it's a better excuse than "college."

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew Once again You are a sad, hypocritical, narcissistic, self centered, entitled manchild if you where gonna lose you could have atleast done it the honorable way.

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater you do relize that online college classes are a thing right?

I am not lying about that. Do i need to prove it to you? Just so you can have a slice of humble pie?

Also why should one apologise if both party's know that it is not genuine?

If anyone narcissistic, its you little wasp

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater  also sad? Hypocritical? Self centered? It takes one to know one little wasp, that's just a fact of life.

And I'm going to live mine the way I want to live, just like everyone else in life (within reason of course) so if you think your petty insults are doing anything other than annoying me ( or serving as my daily entertainment) then i would love to live a day in your self centered reality

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater translation

I know, I just don't care, and considering how your acting and insulting everyone here, no one care's that I'm acting this way towards you either.

 Funny Valentine 「D4C: Love Train」

Okay can someone give me a timeline of this place

 Dave Mathew

@Funny Valentine 「D4C: Love Train」  I'm not sure what your asking or how to answer it other than saying start from the beginning

 Dave Mathew

@Funny Valentine 「D4C: Love Train」 also, as I've made it my little tradition to say this.

Have a nice day or night!

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew You continue to prove once again why you are a hypocrite i mean narssasistic? Me? Lmao look who's talking kid i mean what's this about a "Mr. wasp?" are you seriously gonna resort to name calling now Mr. Hypocrite? 😂

how old are you?

Also stop with the excuses this has nothing to do with "college" and you know it.

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew It takes one to know one and yet you keep proving time and time again you are one Mr. Hypocrite thAt's juSt a FaCt oF liFe.

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew Oh i think im doing more than just annoying you if im "serving you" as "your daily entertainment" Mr. Hypocrite im the highlight of your life. ;)

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew So you are also indifferent Mr. Hypocrite? Great now your a Hypocritical, narcissistic, self centered, entitled and INDIFFERENT manchild.

Also back with the "no one cares" comment? Are you seriously gonna resort on others now to flat up your pathetic ego more? That's right! Where are you buddies when you need them??? "DeFeND mE gUyS WhErE aRe yOU???"

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater  highlight of my life?

Your not one of my many books or literature so I'm afraid that statement is false.

Nice try though

Try again

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew Yes highlight of your life your too much of a uneducated hypocritical, narcissistic, self centered, entitled and indifferent manchild to read any books or literature Mr. Hypocrite so i'm afraid that statement is false.

Nice try though. ;)

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater journey to the west

Mark of the dragonfly

Champion

I have read many books

Your ego is just so horrifically bloated that you refuse to believe anything that contradicts your self centered view of reality. It would be sad if it wasn't so funny to see you make a compleate and utter fool of yourself, but I'm not going to stop you.

The only one who looks bad here is you little germ

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater also do you really need to be an jerk to everyone else in this comment?

You are not doing any favors for yourself little germ

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew "Your ego is just so horrifically bloated"

Look who's talking.

And then you wonder why i call you a hypocrite. 😂🤦‍♂️

"Self centered view"

 Look who's talking

It's amazing how you can make everything that comes out of your mouth sound as hypocritical as possible.

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew Who do you see me being a jerk to other than your hypocritical self? If i responded to someone in a bad way it's because they probably said something stupid to begin with so your not doing yourself any favors by asking little hypocrite or do you need someone to defend you? ;)

 Dave Mathew

@Julio Figueroa hello and have a nice day

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater of course i know that you are just going to respond with more insults, so please by all means, scream your head off at me on the INTERNET.

So that I can just laugh at your attempts to hurt my feelings

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew You are a very flawed man Dave what would your parents think after seeing the way you act? Why keep fighting me if you know your not gonna win anyway? Why be indifferent and not apologize for your own mistakes?

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew I tried to work with you and you blew it then you wonder why you keep getting "scream" at when in truth your a terrible person.

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater there is a difference between being a terrible person, and acting like one to others

You sir are the latter or have you forgotten how you acted to the others?

Also you completely ignored what i said to you.

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew I mean stop with these excuses 🤦‍♂️ "b..but.. it's the INTERNET!" It's the internet but you behave cuz im not gonna let you get your way.

"I can just laugh at your attemps to hurt my feelings" Your not laughing Dave your not laughing.... If anything i can tell your getting upset.

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew No Dave you are a terrible person this is the real you, not some fake persona you try to make everyone else believe.

"You sir are the latter" how ironic coming from you.

"have you forgotten how you acted to others?" I already explained this to you but ironically you forgot.

"You completely ignored what i said to you" You know Dave in all my years on the internet sometimes i think you are the most hypocritical person on the planet. 🤦‍♂️

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater  who is the antagonistic one here? Cause it definetly isn't me

You poor, poor pathetic welp, barking  and baying like anything you say will ever matter.

No your words don't hurt me, because they are artificial, fake, designed and spoken for the soul purpose of inflicting pain without putting actual feeling behind it.

Ha...hahahaha.......HAHAHAHAHA,

No

Your words are hollow and do not deserve the electrons my brain cells would have to burn to process them

Just like you

Your not special, your not unique, your not important

And you never will be, not now, not ever

So go ahead welpling, keep making a fool of yourself

I'll just watch the show

Laughing all the while

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater and in your ivory tower of hypocrisy did you ever once realize

I never denied what you have been saying?

You are a parasite mr hater, somethong that must tear everyone down to justify their worthless existance

Perhaps i am one too, but that's were our similarities end

Your lash out at anyone you see as below you

I lash out at people who do what you and armu did, insult and tear into someone because they dared to have an opinion you did not agree with or lash out at people who defend themselves from other people like you.

I never said i was better, but does it really matter in the end?

At the end of the day one of us looks like the bad guy to everyone else

And since I haven't been antagonizing everyone participating in this

It's  most definetly NOT, me who's the bad guy

Try to say im wrong here

 Funny Valentine 「D4C: Love Train」

Dave Mathew Do you have a prediction for how long this will last

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew And that's where your wrong you poor, poor pathetic hypocrite your the antagonist here Dave not me.

"Your words don't hurt me" That's what you say Dave but where did your narcissistic self go? ;)

Where did all your confidence go when everything you write now looks like your shaking out of anger, sadness or both? You are slowly breaking down... showing your true colors as you can't even have a normal conversation anymore.

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew "I'll just watch the show! Laughing all the while..." Of course from the outside your smiling to preserve your fragile ego and as to not humilate yourself any futher but from the inside we all know how that looks like so don't worry Dave you are not a clown you are the entire circus.

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew "You are a parasite" and you are a hypocrite.

" Somethong that must tear everyone down" Everyone who is a idiot that is.

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew "You lash out at anyone you see as below you!" Dave don't be ridiculous im not as narcissistic as you or at all for that matter.

"I lash out at anyone who do what you and armu did!" A mistake you will regret as you started all of this and i aim to end it.

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew "Insult and tear into someone because they dared to have an opinion you did not agree with" If i do not agree with your opinion ( especially if it's wrong ) then im simply not gonna let you have it.

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew "Or lash out at people who defend themselves" And when did that ever happen again?

"At the end of the day one of us looks like the bad guy to everyone else" that being you of course since you did not apologize.

"It's most definitely NOT, me who's the bad guy" I disagree.

"Try to say im wrong here" Already did.

 Mr. Hater

@Funny Valentine 「D4C: Love Train」 Dave is starting to break down so he won't last much longer now give it a few more days he'll give up by then if he knows what good for him.

 Julio Figueroa

Mr. Hater Going back to the main comment that started it all I do think this game is the worst in the series compared the the rest even though there isn’t a large list

 Dave Mathew

@Julio Figueroa that is a fair opinion to have

I know its not the best, there are parts of it that definitely could have been improved, but i enjoyed it for what it was.

(Though its not really worth replaying)

 Dave Mathew

@Funny Valentine 「D4C: Love Train」 a few day's at least

Honestly I'm guessing the comment count will reach the 500-600 before this is over considering the fact that I'm not going to let him keep insulting everybody and the fact that he is a brick wall of stubborn and rudeness

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater ...you do realize that you can't actually see me when im writing this right?

It's sad to see that your logic is this twisted really

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater everyone is entitled to their opinion whether you like it or not.

Do you see yourself as some kind of god or something?

Thats sad, your sad

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater "not narcissistic"

The fact that you say that other people should not be allowed to have opinions if you don't agree with them says otherwise.

Your just digging a grave for yourself here, do you not relize that?

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater so let me just clear the air so we are all on the same page.

I agree that the game is not perfect, in fact i would even say that parts of it are downright bad, but it is still enjoyable to play through it for the first time and the music is on point.

I agree that they could have done some things better and some things differently but this is what we got, so might as well enjoy it for what it is.

The reason I was so hostile to armu is because he was insulting somebody for enjoying the music of the game, so I responded in turn with a quick jab to get him to back off

What i didn't expect was for him to retaliate so violently to me, or to keep going for that matter

Truth be told, I don't mind that armu doesn't like the game. It's his opinion to have and I respect it, but that does not give him the right to insult others for their taste in game's or music

If he had worded his response in a less hostile manner, i would not have responded at all.

The same go's for you to Mr Hater

I have no problem with your opinion or that you dislike the game or me, it's your opinion and your allowed to have it, but when you start insulting others and call them morons just because you have an issue with their opinion?

Thats when i started this hostility towards you, nothing else to it than that.

So no your words are not hurting me, they are not showing my "true self" to the world, they are said souly to get you to leave (since a apology seems unlikely)

Nothing more to it

So with that said lets just start all over again on a more positve note

ahem

Hello Mr Hater and armu, I am dave mathew and I enjoy this games music and a bit of it's gameplay, though I wholeheartedly agree that it could have been made far, FAR better in comparison to the others, I personally think that its...ok...standing on its own.

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew "I'm not going to let him keep insulting everybody" Jesus christ are you trying to get sympathy from others now as if im villian here? 🤦‍♂️

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater ...you kind of just...ignored the main point of what i just said.

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew Cuz im not done responding yet i took a few hour break anyway where was i?

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew "Do you realize that you can't actually see me when im writing this right?" Yes but i don't need to your reaction says it all Dave.

"It's "sad" to see that your logic is this twisted" And it's sad to see that a "college student" is this hypocritical, narcissistic, self centered, entitled and indifferent.

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew "That's sad, your sad" Your right it's sad that a "college student" could be behaving like this.

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew "Your just digging a grave for yourself here, do you relize that?" Yes Dave i realize that your digging a grave for yourself by fighting me.

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew "Music is on point" You must have terrible taste in music then as it's the weakest in the franchise.

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew "The reason i was so hostile to armu is because he was insulting somebody for enjoying the music of the game" Because he was wrong to begin with he didn't even play the other games...

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew "What i didn't expect was for him to retaliate so violently to me, or to keep going for that matter" You started confrontation and on the internet that could have serious consequences especially if im around so what did you expect??? For him to grab he's bags and back off??

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew "Armu does not have the right to insult others for their taste in game's music" It's call freedom of speech sweatheart and on the internet people are very vocal about everything so for once don't be such a hypocrite.

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew "If he worded his response in a less hostile manner, i would have not responded at all" And if you worded your response in a non hostile way he wouldn't had retaliated at all and this whole mess wouldn't had started.

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew "You start insulting others and call them morons just because you have a issue with their opinion?" A simple moron doesn't hurt they are wrong to begin with and if they wish to go even futher than they can be my guest.

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew "That's when i started this hostility towards you, nothing else to it than that" You started being hostile to me from the beginning as you made THE EXACT.SAME.MISTAKE as you did with aramaru so don't pretend like your some kind of social justice hero.

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew it's rather cute that you think your opinion matters to me Besides, im not criticizing your taste in music or questioning your intellenge ThAt'S tOO eAsY

You started confrontation and where quick to jump to assumptions with that narcissistic as hell start if you would have responded in a non hostile manner we wouldn't be having this long argument so no you didn't start being hostile to me because you saw me insulting other people Dave. 🤦‍♂️

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew "Your words are not hurting me" That's what they all say as you aren't exactly making your parents proud. 🤦‍♂️

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew "My words are said souly to get you to leave" That's never going to happen Dave i have grown very persistent over the years and trust me persistence pays and i will stay here for months if i had to will you?

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew "A apology seems unlikely" Then you will perish here eventually with me as it's either: You apologize to aramaru now and we'll be on our way or we gonna be staying here for a long, LONG time.

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew "So with that being said lets just start all over on a more positive note" We aren't gonna start all over on a more positive note until you start apologizing Dave.

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater then answer this one question

Are you going to apologize for your own hostility?

I made it clear with that comment that i have npthing against you  and trying to calm everything down so the apologise CAN be said and yet you doing exactly what armu did and are throwing this opportunity right back into my face.

Could i have responded to armu in a better manner?

Yes

Did you have to insult everyone present and then demand that both me and the wronged party?

No

Were you wrong to come to armus defence?

Also no

Are you doing a good job of disabling the situation and making an effort to not appear hostile?

No

For past reference the reason I am calling you a hypocrite is because your doing the exact same things your accusing me of.

So why should i take you seriously?

Why should i not see you as a joke for this?

I made mistakes in this conversation, but so have you.

So lets just start over again on a more positive note, Then when we calmed down, we can give each other a genuine apology without it having any negativity and spite behind it. That seems reasonable right?

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew "Are you going to apologize for your own hostility?" Short answer: No unlike you i did nothing wrong Dave so it's either you apologize to aramaru and behave or you slowly perish with me for months either way i consider it a win, win.

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew "I made it clear with that comment that i have npthing against you" Gee it sure doesn't seem that way otherwise you would have apologize.

"Trying to calm everything down" You keep provoking a argument by still not apologizing and trust me Dave it's only get worse from here.

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew "So the apology CAN be said" Good then do it.

"You doing exactly what armu did" Stop with these assumptions and just apologize. 🤦‍♂️

"You are throwing this opportunity right back into my face" What are you talking about???

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew "Did you have to insult everyone present" Jesus christ... again when did this EVER happen? 🤦‍♂️

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew "Are you doing a good job of disabling the situation and making a effort to not appear hostile?" If it isn't obvios enough at this point let me remind you that this is something you should be doing yourself not me otherwise expect to keep arguing.

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew "The reason i am calling you a hypocrite is because your doing the exact same things your a accusing me of" Are you seriously gonna pull the no u card? Assumptions, Hypocricy and irony that's all you do i mean how else would you defend yourself?

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew "Why should i take you seriously?" Yes Dave tell me.

"Why should i not see you as a joke for this?" Yes Dave i wanna know.

You see where this is going? the irony.

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew "I made mistakes in this conversation, but so have you" No just you Dave remind me again what "mistakes" i made? 🤦‍♂️

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew "Let's start over on a more positive note" apologize to aramaru first then i might consider and we'll be on our way.

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew "We can give each other a genuine apology" I wanna see a gunuine apology for aramaru first.

"That seems reasonable right?" Apologize then i'll think about it.

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater ...sigh

Ok I'll just be frank here and ask you to answer this question with a yes or a no

If someone is being rude and overly negative to you and you apologise to them, would you honestly believe that the apology is genuine? That is isn't some backhanded mockery towards you?

If you answer yes to that question, then please rethink why im trying to calm everything down and get the hostility to stop BEFORE, I try to give an apology to anyone

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew "Answer this question with a yes or no" Fine ask away.

"If someone is being rude and overly negative to you" because you provoked them to begin with "would you honestly believe that the apology is genuine?" Yes.

"That it isn't some bachanded mockery towards you?" No.

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew "Pls rethink why im trying to calm everything down" Well you can start by apologizing to aramaru.

"And get the hostility to stop" You'll be stopping it by apologizing to aramaru.

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater ...so you honestly think someone you have been insulting for the past few days would actually be able to give you an apology without any sarcasm or spite behind it?

...

Wat

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater the point I'm making here is that you and I are angry, so any apology we would give would clearly be seen as false

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater as for the insulting everyone thing

...

Did you seriously forget the fact that you called 3 people morons for having an opinion

Insulted everyone who has responded to you in one way or another

And the fact that you opened up your intro into this by calling everyone present garbage and defending someone who was being hostile to everyone period

Even you have to admit that what you did was just as bad, if not worse, than how I originally responded to armu

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew "So you honestly think someone you have been insulting for the past few days would actually be able to give you an apology without any sarcasm or spite behind it?"

I already told you yes or do i need to clarify more? what is this twisted mentality you have?

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew "The point i'm making here is that you and I are angry?" Again stop making assumptions Dave it's just you. 🤦‍♂️

"So any apology we would give would clearly be seen as false" I myself don't have make a apology as i didn't do anything wrong you on a the other hand....

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater please reference my comment listing everything you did wrong as well as your own clame of not being a hypocrite and then try saying that again

And no im not angry

Annoyed? Maby, but it takes a lot more than this kind of conversation to actually anger.

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew "As for the insulting to everyone" Dave listen to me if you keep up your assumptions, hypocricy and irony im honestly gonna stop listening to you and keep arguing as you are doing a terrible job at de-escaleting the situation and only provoking me even futher if you want to come to some sort of agreement then:

1\. Stop being defensive

2\. Don't tell opinions or to calm a person down

3\. And apologize to aramaru since you where in the wrong NOT me

If you fail to do ANY of these things again then im done listening to your nonsense and this time we'll sticking to arguing until you are gone.

16

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew Now final chance behave and do the right thing as i already listen to you for far, FAR too long and honestly even i get tired of hearing your same bs over and over again and if you want to play it that way then so will i now DECIDE:

Will you one: apologize and stop being or doing all the above?

Or

Would you two: Continue this argument?

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater ...listening?

Do you honestly think you have been listening?

Mr. Hater

Since you clearly refuse to see the truth, I am going to go through all of your comments, and I'm going to show you exactly why you are a hypocrite

So let me give you a last warning Mr.Hater

Stop for five seconds, go back to your first comment, and see how you reacted to everyone.

Because your the aggressor in this scenario as i have already pointed out to you

And don't realize this yourself i will take the words you have said so carelessly and \* Show you\*

Ps. this bolding thing you are useing is not impressive, and does not make what you are saying intimidating.

Pps. I have 3 other siblings Hater,

Its going to take alot more than your pointless dribbling to actually upset me.

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew There's not gonna be anymore listening Dave i gave you another chance and you unsurprisingly blew it now we argue again and this time we'll sticking to it because of your own stupidity until you are out of here for good.

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew Weeks, months, years whatever it takes little hypocrite you are a complete disgrace of a "college student" and i am honestly disgusted to be talking to you at this point.

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew Assumptions, hypocricy and irony IS.ALL.YOU.DO. and it will be the end of you as you are not a "college student" you are egotistical maniac, you are a FAILURE, a failure to your family and relatives and a failure to yourself. 🤦‍♂️

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater and I would love to have never met such a hypocritical disappointment such as yourself, but we don't always get what we want now do we?

You think you can best me in a competition of sass?

You think your insults have any weight?

Think again

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater I road this storm for 8 whole months with armu

You think you will be a contest?

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew Hypocritical, narcissistic manchild response pls try again.

From now on as punishment every reply will be answer the same way until you get your head straight or i drag you out of this comment chain completely by any means necessary.

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater ...thats it?

Thats your plan to make me leave?

...

Seriously? Thats it?

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew Pls try again.

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater it's "please try again"

Do try to use proper English

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew Hypocritical response pls try again.

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater please try again with proper english

 Dave Mathew

@Mr. Hater as I said, i have 3 other siblings, do you really think this is going to work?

 Dave Mathew

@No OwO can't believe i didn't do this sooner but thank you

 Mecha Tar

Everyone here is an immature moron who doesnt know the stop, its just true, so both of you stop, and if you reply to me thats how i know you haven't stopped, so with that being said

REALITY IS AN ILLUSION AND THE UNIVERSE IS A HOLOGRAM, BUY GOLD, BYEEE

 Mr. Hater

@Mecha Tar Blame it all on Dave he's stubborness started this and he refuses to take responsibility.

 Dave Mathew

@Mecha Tar honestly I know that this whole situation is stupid, and I have tried to calm things down.

Those attempts just haven't worked due to said stubbornness.

Honestly, this is the internet, this is not something that should be treated so seriously.

(Though honestly I'm just doing this to rile him up at this point...regardless you are right, I'll reel it in.)

Ps. "Looks at the end of your message"....wat

 Mecha Tar

The end of the message is a reference to a show that goes by the name of gravity falls

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew No those attemps didn't work because you are a clown and are incapable to look yourself in a mirror and realize you are all the above such as a hypocrite, narcissistic etc.

 Mr. Hater

@Mecha Tar Yes Bill cypher  i believe was he's name says that tho on the other hand do not expect Dave to know anything about this.

 Mr. Hater

@Dave Mathew It's been 3 days now so i won told you i would drag you out eventually goodbye little hypocrite.

 Roshambo Ro

if the internet were an anime this would be it and it's a story to behold

1st arc (insults vs logic):

You have the band of heroes working to defeat a final boss "Amararu" who thinks only his opinion matters, attacking all who oppose him, to deluded to see maybe the world is full of different people who are entitled to their opinions/tastes as much as he and his accomplice deem them garbage for ever having one of them. This is to defend one of the heroes who was immediately attacked for having a

2nd arc (Rise of the hated egotist):

Once the boss is down and out his lacky (Mr Hater, which is a fitting name for his roll) rises up to finish what his master started. His master \[ILLEGIBLE\] behind him as he immediately attacks the heros upon arrival- nobody knows where he came from. Then its him and Dave as they fight a war bigger than WW2, Dave trying to stop and calm his insults as Mr Hater DEFENDS SOMEONE WHO BELITTLED A PERSON FOR HAVING A DIFFERENT OPINION trying. He tries to justify these actions by constantly repeating Dave is a hypocrite hoping he'll believe it someday.

Mind Games (battle of wills):

The new boss (Mr Hater) believes he's the good guy by trying to manipulate Dave into believing he is the bad guy by telling him things hes not and to apologise for standing up to the bully he is now protecting (also after he defends a guy who BELITTLED someone for having different opinion - you start to question his motives a lot).

This is giving me Steven universe season 5 finale vibes

Says things like he's a bad college student or a faliure to his family (tbh you don't bring family into stuff like this - so a pretty low blow by the boss)

Neither side gives in and the boss deludes himself to think he HE is in the right after saying himself that people who genuinely like this video have garbage tastes and bad opinions.

Failed restart (traquility gone wrong):

At one point the hero offers a do over which is refused due to the boss wanting an undeserved apology for his defeated comrade (who I don't need to remind you what he did, but he doesn’t need to apologise) but OH NO \[UNFINISHED\]

\-- FINAL PRE-DELETEION REPLY ON RECORD CURRENTLY --

 Mr. Hater

@Roshambo Ro A entertaining read but i'll honestly argue against that as it almost all sounds like one sided propaganda.

 Mr. Hater 

@Roshambo Ro So let's start with the "1st arc" insults vs "logic." 🤦‍♂️

We already on a good start

"You have the band of heroes" More like a band of hypocritical morons if that's you mean as a real "hero" ( cough cough Dave...) wouldn't had provoked a whole argument to begin with.

"Working to defeat a final boss Aramaru who thinks only his opinion matter" Oh don't start with the assumptions 🤦‍♂️ he simply disagreed on he's opinion because it was wrong to begin with he didn't even play the other games at the time but i guess he's own opinion is not allowed now is it you hypocrites?

"Attacking all who oppose him" Other way around he got attack by everybody and was defending himself but atleast he manage on he's own as something very similar happen to me too but in a Pokémon mystery dungeon video where i eventually prevailed agaisnt a entire comment section after 2 years or less so this one wasn't NEARLY as bad as that one.

 Mr. Hater

@Roshambo Ro Anyway continue in on with arc 1:

"Too deluded to see maybe the world IS full of different people" Your right Shambo yet you and others failed to realize that with Aramaru making you a hypocrite and ruining your credibility.

That's it for arc 1 on to the next one.

 Mr. Hater

@Roshambo Ro "His master cowers behind him" Just as your master ( that being Dave ) cowers behind you how much you wanna bet he's gonna come back now?

"Nobody knows where he came from" Nobody knows where anybody came from this is the internet sweety.

"Dave trying to stop and calm his insults" More like Dave provoking the situation futher.

"Mr. Hater DEFENDS SOMEONE WHO BELITTLED A PERSON FOR HAVING" A WRONG OPINION.

"He tries to justify these actions by constandly repeating Dave is a hypocrite" Along other things cuz he keeps proving he is one time and time again.

"Hoping he'll believe it someday" Oh im sure he does he's not that stupid atleast.

 Mr. Hater

@Roshambo Ro 3rd arc: "Mind games" battle of wills.

"The new boss Mr. Hater" What happen to me being aramaru's underling? 😂

"Believes he's the good guy by trying to manipulate Dave into believing he's the bad guy" Because it's true Dave is a hypocritical, narcissistic, self centered, entitled, indifferent manchild with no real self regard for others views and no im not manipulating him ThAt'S tOO eAsY get the reference Dave if your reading this?

 Roshambo Ro

@Mr. Hater

Before you continue pls understand this was JUST a STORY poking fun at how dumb this whole ordeal is. Pls take the arcs and plot with a mere grain of salt. There are no masters or legacies to carry out and no one is cowering, obviously not

I mean, you got "good guys" and a "big bad boss" OBVIOUSLY it's going to be exaggerated and extremely one sided to the good guys, even to my own thoughts and feelings. The characters are exaggerated for the story

When you guys are all like "hahaha fool" and "I see you've got some bite" and "once again your a hypocrite", (that sound like one liners off of an anime, which there are a bunch of one liners in this feed) I couldn't help but turn it into a story. If you read your and Dave's lines back it's something right at home with jojo's BA, honestly kind of funny

It's an entertaining read and that's all it ever will be and I am sorry if you feel attacked or offended as it truly wasn't aimed at causing you to dissect the story, exaggerated for the sake of the plot, which there are roles in because it's a story.

This isn't me finishing what Dave didn't or plastering propaganda on the walls and rallying the squad to charge full open arms into battle like some sort of heroes avenging him (or the "master" as you put it), NO. This is me taking what looked like nothing more than a battle of wills jojo's story and having fun with it because it looked bizarre. Who knows, maybe I'll make this a concept some day because this is a generally good one.

Also one last thing, the way you and Dave word your writing makes it believable that if not for all this pointless bickering, you guys could've been friends. It's a shame you guys don't see that maybe your not complete opposites. So just be cool

I hope this chat a good day and that I can finally get some opinions for SPM as I really like that game (an SPM opinion from you is what I want)

 Mr. Hater

@Roshambo Ro "Telling him things he's not" Shambo shambo listen to me he's a terrible person ok? He's a terrible person he's not some hero trying to save the day he's a egotistical maniac in complete denial and a FAILURE to both his parents and himself.

"To apologise for standing up to the bully" You call that standing up to the bully!? Aramaru had like the entire comment section on him for a opinion\*you yourself's\* didn't like you hypocrites how would you think that will make him feel? You people disgust me.

"You start to question he's motives alot" BE.MORE.OPEN.MINDED. Shambo not this one sided bs just go back and think about it this is a guy who only played ONE PAPER MARIO GAME at the time he even admit to it.

"Tbh you don't bring family into this" He is supposely a college student so he's attitude is completely unacceptable and his parents should be ashame of themselves for raising such a child.

"Pretty low blow by the boss" Pretty low blow by Dave for his inexcusable behavier.

 Roshambo Ro

There has been a lot of talk about this track being just good or trash with no one giving any reasons why. I propose we talk about what makes this track good and bad to people who do or don't like it to come to an understanding of where each one of us is coming from.

 Roshambo Ro

@Mr. Hater

There are a LOT of things I could say about this drama for EVERYONE involved,  but I'm not as it would be childish to milk this beef even more and that would defy why I'M here, to just mock a heated situation. Overall, I say it's finally time to lay this beef to rest. RIP

This has been the most... interesting comment section I have ever seen and all I really can say is... just WoW, I'll never forgetti this spaghetti.

It was a fun read while it lasted I guess

Anyone who WANTS TO continue to argue from this point onwards, pls just stop, there's no point.

It's just not worth tearing each other apart anymore like savages (not that it ever was but I digress). If that means forgetting about this entire reply section and my little story then by all means do what you must guys.

THIS... IS... OVER!!! (for really real this time)

Anyways, we're all here because of Mario so why not talk about the guy huh.

If you want, you could answer my questions I asked on SPM, this track or even the franchise as a whole. Or not, the choice really is yours if we let this reply section waste away into the abyss or turn it into something good.

Until the next comment (I pray it's positive)

See ya

Ps. Lunar you've finally hit 500 comments mate

Let's GOOO!!!

Edit: well there are 500 replies now so this is the end maybe unless a idiot starts it up again

 Livingbeast

i can sleep peacefully knowing the gold that this whole thing was

 dis pretty smug

Reading this whole comment thread was a rollercoaster of emotions The Retardedness of Mr.Hater and Amararu to Dave cooking up these snatcher like responses is such brilliance too bad it ended all of this over a theme it was honestly amazing Thank you Mr.Hater and Amararu for showing me entertainment in your rage and Dave for bringing witty responses Kudos.

@Dave Mathew Hey man. This must have been a wild ride for you, lol! Also if  Mr. Hater replies, then I will ignore him knowing that he's an asshole who recycles the same points.

 Spiritgate 04

@buttsicle I know right? This is something that should be on Gamerfrommars internet hall of fame.

 Spiritgate 04

@TheWaterMan I guess I'll start it. I CANT WAIT FOR ORIGAMI KING! Ok, but seriously that game looks amazing and I think they should continue down that path. Some people are saying it should continue until it goes back to the TTYD formula, but I don't think it should we shouldn't judge a game for what it isn't, but for what it is. If people do that then they will get a game that they will love more than TTYD. Constantly wanting stuff from the past led to the mess that is the sonic series where they are stuck between using nostalgia and trying to make interesting new concepts. I just think we should embrace new and original ideas.

@everyone

Woah guys, chill.

I know all of you want to see each others heads on pikes, but we can just enjoy the music.

 TheBluebomber875

Aramaru 1837 honestly you sound like a 9yo. You only care about your own opinion and refuse to let anyone share their opinion. So take off your dirty nostalgia goggles for a second and let us enjoy the song

 Yoshi705

@Aramaru 1837 ...

It's been 10 months, but

64: really good, but kinda basic

TTYD: a bop but not the best

SPM: amazing but is basically a remix

SS: same thing (also if you're going to insult people for liking the great music of a below average game in an amazing series then why are you here)

CS: great

My favorite is SPM, but they all have their flaws.

Listen dude, I don't have SS, but it has my second favorite final battle theme.

I don't really love the older ones', but i see why they're great and still like them.

just... dislike the vid and be on your way.

 Aramaru 1837

Yoshi705 idgaf about your opinion. This song is still shit

 Yoshi705

@Aramaru 1837 welp i tried

 Yoshi705

@Aramaru 1837 listen i'm trying to be polite

nobody asked and yet i did it

 Yoshi705

@Aramaru 1837 also you shouldn't just insult someone because of their opinion unless it's something really bad

this isn't bad

good day sir
