I do thing's different, I pride myself with that. This is my "stack", the services I use daily. I pay for almost each one (where of course it's applicable), and that's ok because I pay a fair price for the service offered. There is nothing special about these services, they are so forgettable I wrote them here to remind myself, and contrary, their forgetfulness is what makes them beautiful.

There are no flashy UI's, no, these are often two tone. Little money was invested in UX, so expect wierd deep menus and beautiful control. These sites are one person shows, often, so support is handled impressively fast and passionately by Steve, the founder, lead developer, and agent. Steve has no corporate interest, really, all he hopes is to make a few bucks back and keep the service running, and because of that minimalism Steve can afford to ask peanuts, say 3$ a month.

Of course, not all services are this, primarily limited by cost of entry, but they get as close as possible.

I will run a service like this, someday.

## What I kept 

### [[Bitwarden]]

Bitwarden is ok, the UX could use work and so could the extension. Their open source stewardship could use some work. It is dirt fucking cheap, open source, and works pretty okish, but great for it's price, improvements are:

#### Extension

- Prompt to login on potential autofill, currently it just does not.
- Actually show autofill options when clicking on a login field

#### UX

- When I search something and click the add `new item` the name field should populate with whatever that search was

#### Stewardship

- PR's are not really merged, they tell me they are working on this

#### But like

IT'S SO GOOD FOR IT'S PRICE, IT'S INDIE, AND IT'S OPEN SOURCEEEE

### [[cloudflare]]

We are off to a bad start, but cloudflare's generosity is astounding. I register my domains through them because only cloudflare offers registration with zero markup.

I am aware of https://gandi.net as an alternative, but they strike me as little improvement, for a steep markup. Of course, price is not a huge factor, but their site tells a different story then their goals. They claim to support net neutrality, but fail to understand what it fully is. They claim to stand up to large monopolies, but they strive to be one, offering a website builder, [[wordpress]] hosting, flash sales, referrals, and a crappy rebrand. They are not [[open source]] as they attempt to mislead. They do try, I suppose, and they live up to their claims to a certain degree with decent support and donations to open projects. Not to say [[cloudflare]] is better, they play the good guys with incredibly generous [[free]] plans. The only reason I pay them money is their [[domain]]s, that are also free in the sense they don't mark them up. The arm they have over our internet is scary though, if they wanted to they could deplatform everyone.

There is no good option here, and there never will be due to [[ICANN]]'s enraging fees.

## And what I ditched

### [[neeva]]

Personally neeva was not for me, I was not a big fan of their ui and I prefer the ui of [[duckduckgo]] and serex, but for fans of modern ui I suggest [checking it out](https://neeva.com/p/signup?o=s&c=Fam1BIlxFIXO1x3h-IHMxJJwfb4) (This link gives you three months free, it also gives me 1 month free but I won't be using it). I have mixed feelings:

![[Pasted image 20211114183310.png]]

I really like what they bring to the table in regards to this idea of unified search. You can intergrate with some gardens, I intergrated with [[Google]], [[Notion]], and [[GitHub]]. There is no API for making new ones, and it felt like the current ones were dragging me back in the wrong direction. The existing intergrations are ok, and it really seems they know their audience, so kudo's to them on that. Let me list some sites they have to give you an idea

- Box
- Notion
- Figma
- Slack

I don't really know how I feel about how "personal results" and "normal" results are different, I think they should be mixed and then you can easily filter between personal stuff.

![[Pasted image 20211114180923.png]]

In this screenshot, I searched for S.B ðŸ‘€. If I searched just for S.B, I would have gotten normal results for ~~them~~, I had to navigate to the personal results (S.T.B) for the emails with ~~them~~, and then there was no normal results. If ~~they~~ were saved as S.B instead of S.T.B then I would actually have no way to get normal results, when I hit enter on an exact match it takes me to the personal results. The query matching was good though

![[Pasted image 20211114181557.png]]

I also was not a fan of the bubble they help you build. You can opt out of seeing news from certain sites, but goodness knows what we need is to escape this bubble, not to deliberately blow one.

In the end, for me, this was the right idea in the wrong way, I hope duck or some other party not lead by google executives implements personal search for themself, it could be quite useful.
