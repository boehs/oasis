Today when talking on discord someone mentioned their approval for Khan Academy, stating that it was what allowed them to pass their class. I have too consulted Khan Academy on a few occasions, and I thought the teaching was well done. I believe education is a human right, and I thought I would see what I could do to contribute. I was alarmed to discover the lack of ways to do so.

I voiced my thoughts in a brief way in discord, and was quickly attacked by nearly everyone there. People seem to all love khan, holding it as the savior of education, and in some way's, it is. Khan was the first platform I could find to offer **easily** accessible k-12-beyond learning for anyone, for free. It provides a central place with "trusted" content, but ultimately khan academy solves no issues in our education system, while getting all the support of the internet.

## A dictatorship

There is no public information on khan academies power structure, aside from the fact that it has [executives](https://www.khanacademy.org/about/our-board). There is no way to vote in leaders, and no real way to hold them accountable.
