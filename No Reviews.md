Sometimes, when I enjoy (or don't enjoy) using a product, I will write about it. These are called showcases. I will leave my opinion, but not a score. It's not my job to label things, nor anyone else's. I can help guide you, but ultimately it's your call if you want to use something, or even just try it. You can't just turn a 3 dimensional product with so many aspects into a letter grade perfectly.
