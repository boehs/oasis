## I need to drive for XYZ!

!? Why?

If you can not use public transportation because you have some disability that makes it infeasible, cars are acceptable.

If you can not use public transportation because there is no good public
options in your area, that's infuriating, but acceptable.

If you are in a hurry, I suppose you can drive, but consider that you could be getting work done while you commute on a train/bus.

If you can not use transportation because you have some wierd route, consider not having a wierd route. No, for real. Many of us are working remotely, live where you want to live man.

## It's ok, I have an electric car!

They are simply a lesser evil. WSJ has a great article on the subject: https://www.wsj.com/graphics/are-electric-cars-really-better-for-the-environment/

TD;LR

- 2x less pollution after 200k miles
- Actually cheaper long term

But, most critisizims of cars still apply. I outline these issues below, but 

- Manufacturing actually produces more emissions than normal cars (these are quickly offsetted)
- A disturbing amount of charging stations are still powered by fossil fuels, it's certainly not zero impact, probably for most 50% of a normal car
- Huge waste of space, just like cars

## Ok so why should I "fuck" cars?

- Learn to love your world. People frequently report that when they are not driving they are more observent and see more beauty around them. Riding through the city on a bike is a magical experience.
- Pay less, people spend on average 400-1000$ a year on maintenance, and then much much more on gas
- Care for the environment
- Stop anywhere, reach harder places.
- Good for your health, you will find your self walking or biking more!
- [feel the wind in your face](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=BbfWRCQ3j6I)
- Your commute is more pretty (if biking, find river/park routes if possible, if riding the train sit back!)
- if your doing a long commute can work or sleep

### Ok, I get I gain stuff, but what's wrong with cars?

- Waste of space, 175 meters for a road = 9 meters for a train in terms of capacity. Let's not forget that we would actually being using trains/buses less if we drove less, smaller roads = denser cities
- Big pollute

### You seem like a sales man. Why shouldn't I?

- Less safe. Car drivers are dumbasses and tend to hit bikers. Also trains are nasty with covid, provided it's not Amtrak or the likes and instead crowded city trains.
- Slower, probably.
- People living outside of the city might simply not have enough options

## So is this a urban movement?

Yeah, probably. In urban environments everywhere is reachable by trains often, but out there it gets harder.

## Can I own a car?

Yeah, we acknowledge there are valid reasons to own a car, as long as you wish you don't not need to own a car your welcome here!

## What to do with roads

We think trees are pretty cool.
