Sorry for being so quiet, some stuff has been going on both in "real life" and personal. Personal wise

- I wanted to go all out [[Linux]], switched from [[manjaro]] to a clean install of [[arch]], messing with [[i3 ]] and [[awesomewm]], trying [[vim]] for the 3rd time this year.
	- I want to have some centralized config file repository
		- does it exist?
			- Edit: Yes it does, no it does not have the features
				- I opened a issue for this, if someone wants to help me flesh this out I will implement it gladly
					- https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/issues/1747
		- if it doesn't add that to the backlog (more on that later)
- I have been fleshing out my website, I want full control of my online identity [[a domain, much more]]. 
	- while my own website is not feeling well (see below), I am now rolling my own [[password manager]], [[pastebin]], [[RSS]] reader, and [[webmail]].
- similarly, I have gone all out in custom email, this has been great! I have many [[sieve]] rules, my favorite being that it sorts mailing lists into their own folders, and also sorts stuff like "reddit.a@boehs.org" into its own folder.
- it's still on my [[todo]] list to make my own garden focused static site generator, I have written a [[outline]] of it but one thing is still unclear, perhaps I will ask for feedback soon.
	- What's more (cc: [[Garden Representations]]), I have come to the conclusion that even a rss feed or a general blog like feed of posts (as opposed to the different pages that actually make up a blog) are also [[garden]]s
		- These are "stage two gardens", they come after the stage one gardens (the posts themselves) are made.
			- Theoretically, there can be unlimited stages of gardens
				- A stage three garden might be a RSS feed of the RSS feeds that make up
- [[wikilinks everywhere]] I really want to finish. I really hate [[dom]] api's though! I miss well thought out programming languages (for instance, after setting innerhtml the variable becomes divorced and further changes don't do anything). I think I can finish it given time but more below.
- So, what do I focus my time on? I have so many great projects, more ideas include
	- I have [[ADHD]], I learned this is a symptom
		- I have been aware of this for as long as I can remember
		- It frustrates me to death
		- Because I have so many ideas I have no idea what to focus on
		- They are all swirling around in my head
		- It's painful
		- Help
